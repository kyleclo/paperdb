However, known methods and physical realizations exhibit considerable usability and customization issues. In this paper, we propose 3D-Auth, a new concept of two-factor authentication. 3D-Auth is based on customizable 3D-printed items that combine two authentication factors in one object. The object bottom contains a uniform grid of conductive dots that are connected to a unique embedded structure inside the item. Based on the interaction with the item, different dots turn into touch-points and form an authentication pattern. This pattern can be recognized by a capacitive touchscreen. Based on an expert design study, we present an interaction space with six categories of possible authentication interactions. In a user study, we demonstrate the feasibility of 3D-Auth items and show that the items are easy to use and the interactions are easy to remember.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

Among those are wearable devices that have embedded cryptographic keys [7]. TangibleRubik provides tangible authentication by the manipulation of a Rubik's Cube [27]. Using TangibleRubik, a user's password consists of a series of moves with the tube, such as turning parts of it. These moves are captured by a webcam. A preliminary user study of TangibleRubik revealed that duration of password entry (34 and 52 seconds) were perceived as too long.

We choose the following baselines: (1) CNN (Zeng et al., 2014), BILSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa , which are widely used as text encoders for relation extraction tasks; (2) HINBERT (Tang et al., 2020) which employs a hierarchical inference network to leverage the abundant information from different sources; (3) CorefBERT (Ye et al., 2020) which proposes a pre-training method to help BERT capture the coreferential relations in context; (4) SpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2020) which masks   (Peng et al., 2020) which introduce sentence-level relation contrastive learning for BERT via distant supervision. For fair comparison, we pre-train these baselines on our constructed pre-training data 10 based on the implementation released by Peng et al. (2020) 11 .

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Benefiting from designing various effective self-supervised learning objectives, such as masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2018), PLMs can effectively capture the syntax and semantics in text to generate informative language representations for downstream NLP tasks. However, conventional pre-training objectives do not explicitly model relational facts, which frequently distribute in text and are crucial for understanding the whole text. To address this issue, some recent studies attempt to improve PLMs to better understand relations between entities (Soares et al., Peng et al., 2020). However, they mainly focus on within-sentence relations in isolation, ignoring the understanding of entities, and the interactions among multiple entities at document level, whose relation understanding involves complex reasoning patterns.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain. Finally, we also perform a thorough investigation of our system performances, providing insights and pinpointing the reasons behind our improvements via a fine-grained evaluation on different label-frequency classes.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_para_1": "Efficient Pre-training in NLP. The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work. Some works (Gong et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020;Gu et al., 2021) propose progressive learning to accelerate the pre-training, which are motivated by the fact that different layers have some similar knowledge (e.g., attention patterns). They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) proposes a task of replaced token detection to predict whether each token in the input was replaced or not, which improves the pre-training efficiency. Our method is orthogonal to this kind of work and the combination of ELECTRA and bert2BERT could achieve better efficiency. In addition, there are several other orthogonal techniques for efficient pre-training: mixed-precision training (Shoeybi et al., 2019), large batch optimization (You et al., 2020), model architecture innovation , layer dropping technique , etc.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_metadata": "Authors: Christopher Chu, Scot Fang, Kevin Knight | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_para_1": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations In recent years, the widening scope of emotion detection tasks led to the rise of another sub-topic: detecting emotions in conversations. This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_metadata": "Authors: Ella Rabinovich, Masih Sultani, S.

The core framework is composed of a shared encoder and a pair of attentional-decoders, crucially assisted by discrimination-based losses and denoising. The framework is trained using unlabeled text collected from en-Wikipedia dump. Our analysis (both quantitative and qualitative involving human evaluators) on public test data shows that the proposed model can perform text-simplification at both lexical and syntactic levels, competitive to existing supervised methods. It also outperforms viable unsupervised baselines. Adding a few labeled pairs helps improve the performance further.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_metadata": "Authors: Shoaib Jameel, S.

A heuristic-based system was first introduced by Chandrasekar and Srinivas (1997) which induces rules for simplification automatically extracted from annotated corpora. Canning and Tait (1999) proposed a modular system that uses NLP tools such as morphological analyzer, POS tagger 1 https://github.com/subramanyamdvss/UnsupNTS plus heuristics to simplify the text both lexically and syntactically. Most of these systems (Siddharthan, 2014) are separately targeted towards lexical and syntactic simplification and are limited to splitting and/or truncating sentences. For paraphrasing based simplification, data-driven approaches were proposed like phrase-based SMT (Specia, 2010;\u0160tajner et al., 2015) or their variants (Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Xu et al., 2016), that combine heuristic and optimization strategies for better TS. Recently proposed TS systems are based on neural seq2seq architecture (Bahdanau et al., 2014) which is modified for TS specific operations (Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017). While these systems produce state of the art results on the popular Wikipedia dataset (Coster and Kauchak, 2011), they may not be generalizable because of the noise and bias in the dataset (Xu et al., 2015) and overfitting. Towards this,\u0160tajner and Nisioi (2018) showed that improved datasets and minor model changes (such as using reduced vocabulary and enabling copy mechanism) help obtain reasonable performance for both in-domain and cross-domain TS.", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_2": "In the unsupervised paradigm, Paetzold and Specia (2016) proposed an unsupervised lexical simplification technique that replaces complex words in the input with simpler synonyms, which are extracted and disambiguated using word embeddings.

Other works related to style transfer Shen et al., 2017;Xu et al., 2018) typically look into the problem of sentiment transformation and are not motivated by the linguistic aspects of TS, and hence not comparable to our work. As far as we know, ours is a first of its kind end-to-end solution for unsupervised TS.

We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_metadata": "Authors: Hyunchul Lim, Jungmin Chung, Changhoon Oh, Sohyun Park, Joonhwan Lee, B.

In this paper we present SoPa, a new model that aims to bridge these two approaches. SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_metadata": "Authors: S.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

A rapidly growing number of experimental studies is successfully using SDT to explain video game play enjoyment and motivation [33][34][35][36][37]39,41,44,45]. Following the SDT-derived Player Experience of Need Satisfaction model (PENS) [37], games satisfy autonomy needs through a number of ways (see [7] for a design-focused review): particularly so-called \"sandbox games\" provide players with \"meaningful choice\" such as choosing different goals, strategies, and actions [37]; customization [25]; improving or customizing one's avatar [33,47,48]; back stories that provide rationales for activity [37]; wide-open, explorable worlds [50]; and the possibility to create and inhabit a character that is highly congruent with one's ideal self [34].", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_para_5": "A rich body of SDT work corroborates that and how particular strategies facilitate an autonomy-supporting contextual climate and thus, autonomy satisfaction and intrinsic motivation across education, parenting, coaching, work, health and psychotherapy (see [43] for a review). These strategies chiefly revolve around providing meaningful rationales for activities (enabling conscious integration), acknowledgement of negative feelings, the use of non-controlling language, the provision of choices, and appealing to basic needs. When it comes to social contexts of gameplay, research has focused on the effect of social presence and social interaction -the general argument being that more social presence and interaction equals a better gaming experience [5,14,17,24,27]. Some studies have explicitly linked the effect of social presence on game enjoyment to SDT, namely the satisfaction of relatedness needs [24].", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors"}}

These characteristics often result in deficient performance of neural network based detection models. In this paper, we propose adaptive scaling, an algorithm which can handle the positive sparsity problem and directly optimize over F-measure via dynamic cost-sensitive learning. To this end, we borrow the idea of marginal utility from economics and propose a theoretical framework for instance importance measuring without introducing any additional hyper-parameters. Experiments show that our algorithm leads to a more effective and stable training of neural network based detection models.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

Related work to this paper mainly includes: Classification on Imbalanced Data. Conventional approaches addressed data imbalance from either data-level or algorithm-level. Data-level approaches resample the training data to maintain the balance between different classes (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002;Drummond et al., 2003). Further improvements on this direction involve how to better sampling data with minimum in-formation loss (Carvajal et al., 2004;Estabrooks et al., 2004;Han et al., 2005;Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro et al., 2011). Algorithm-level approaches attempt to choose an appropriate inductive bias on models or algorithms to make them more suitable on data imbalance condition, including instance weighting (Ting, 2002;Lin et al., 2017), cost-sensitive learning (Anand et al., 1993;Domingos, 1999;Sun et al., 2007;Krawczyk et al., 2014) and active learning approaches (Ertekin et al., 2007a,b;Zhu and Hovy, 2007). F-Measure Optimization. Previous research on F-measure optimization mainly fell into two paradigms (Nan et al., 2012): 1) Decisiontheoretic approaches (DTA), which first estimate a probability model and find the optimal predictions according to that model (Joachims, 2005;Jansche, 2005Jansche, , 2007Dembczynski et al., 2011;Busa-Fekete et al., 2015;Natarajan et al., 2016). The main drawback of these methods is that they need to estimate the joint probability with exponentially many combinations, thus make them hard to use in practice; 2) Empirical utility maximization (EUM) approaches, which adapt approximate methods to find a best classifier in hypothesises (Musicant et al., 2003;Chinta et al., 2013;Parambath et al., 2014;Narasimhan et al., 2014). However, EUM methods depend on thresholds or costs that are not known a priori so time-consuming searching on large development set is required. Our adaptive scaling algorithm is partially inspired by EUM approaches, but is based on the marginal utility framework, which doesn't introduce any additional hyper-parameter or searching procedure. Neural Network based Event Detection. Event detection is a typical task of detection problems. Recently neural network based methods have achieved significant progress in Event Detection. CNNs (Chen et al., 2015;Nguyen and Grishman, 2015) and Bi-LSTMs (Zeng et al., 2016;Yang and Mitchell, 2017) are two effective and widely used models. Some improvements have been made by jointly predicting triggers and arguments  or introducing more complicated architectures to capture larger scale of contexts Ghaeini et al., 2016).", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_para_5": "Extraction For sentence-level relation extraction, we did experiments on TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017) and SemEval-2010 Task 8 (Hendrickx et al., 2019) based on the implementation of Peng et al.

It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent pieces of evidence, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidence as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence.

Popat et al. (2018) attempted to debunk false claims by learning claim representations from relevant articles using an attention mechanism to focus on words that are closely related to the claim. Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules. Similar pipelines were developed by most of the participating teams (Nie et al., 2019;Padia et al., 2018;Alhindi et al., 2018;Hanselowski et al., 2018) in FEVER shared task (Thorne et al., 2018b).

However, the factuality of a claim is independent of people's belief and subjective language use, and human perception is unconsciously prone to misinformation due to the common cognitive biases such as naive realism (Reed et al., 2013) and confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998).", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_1": "A recent trend is that researchers are trying to establish more objective tasks and evidence-based verification solutions, which focus on the use of evidence obtained from more reliable sources, e.g., encyclopedia articles, verified news, etc., as an important distinguishing factor (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018). Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al.

Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_3": "Our experiments adopt the popular three-stage pipeline of FEVER task, comprising document selection, evidence sentence extraction, and claim verification (Thorne et al., 2018b).

(2020) that demonstrated the ability of transformers (BERT, RoBERTa) to function as soft theorem provers. They induce a closed-world reasoning process by fine-tuning on a carefully curated synthetic natural language rulebase. In this work, we transfer this ability to FEVER and gauge the feasibility of such closed-world reasoning. Additionally, we also construct an entity-anonymized version of FEVER following Hermann et al. (2015) for evaluating our proposed models. We construct the anonymized version by masking prominent named entities in the claim-evidence pairs, thereby reducing any reliance on pre-trained factual knowledge.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

The corresponding experimental results are listed in Table 10 and 11. It can be observed that our approach also yields outstanding results on the AOPE task. On the dataset provided by Fan et al. (2019), many methods (Wu et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2022;Li et al., 2022a,b) introduce additional syntactic features to learn better feature representations.

These characteristics often result in deficient performance of neural network based detection models. In this paper, we propose adaptive scaling, an algorithm which can handle the positive sparsity problem and directly optimize over F-measure via dynamic cost-sensitive learning. To this end, we borrow the idea of marginal utility from economics and propose a theoretical framework for instance importance measuring without introducing any additional hyper-parameters. Experiments show that our algorithm leads to a more effective and stable training of neural network based detection models.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_metadata": "Authors: James Fiacco, Samridhi Choudhary, C.

In this work, the authors propose that AAC users should be able to author tones of voice and save and share these tones with other AAC users. The tone authoring process was explored through the ToneTable art piece, which accepts speech audio as input and allows ablebodied users to physically manipulate the tone of that speech [1]. While ToneTable provoked critical thought around the expressivity of speech, it was not a system designed for AAC, or intended to be used by people with speech impairments. Pauletto et. al. [19] investigated the design space of integrating emotional TTS into conversational bot systems. They proposed a brief set of possible design approaches for creating an interface for marking up text with speech attributes, though these design suggestions were not intended for use by AAC device users (i.e., design suggestions involving direct manipulation likely will not work well for an eye-gaze user). They also describe possible designs for displaying speech properties in text.", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_metadata": "Authors: \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Sungjin Ahn, Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

This is important, as changes to our field of view affects how much we see, and can influence thinking processes that enhance or hinder creativity [25,34] and affect human performance [14,29]. As such, we invite HCI practitioners to use peripheral awareness as a neurological state to better understand how we can support human performance in other areas within HCI, such as: health and wellbeing, critical systems, sports, and creative and collaborative work, to name just a few. Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance. In this article we explored a new mechanism for integration focusing on \"inside\" the user's body to design an integration system that reacts to changes in the user's peripheral awareness.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_abstract": "In this work we introduce peripheral awareness as a neurological state for real-time human-computer integration, where the human is assisted by a computer to interact with the world. Changes to the field of view in peripheral awareness have been linked with quality of human performance. This instinctive narrowing of vision that occurs as a threat is perceived has implications in activities that benefit from the user having a wide field of view, such as cycling to navigate the environment. We present \"Ena\", a novel EEG-eBike system that draws from the user's neural activity to determine when the user is in a state of peripheral awareness to regulate engine support. A study with 20 participants revealed various themes and tactics suggesting that peripheral awareness as a neurological state is viable to align human-machine integration with internal bodily processes. Ena suggests that our work facilitates a safe and enjoyable human-computer integration experience.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_metadata": "Authors: Jun Gong, Aakar Gupta, Hrvoje Benko | Venue: ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_metadata": "Authors: Motohiro Makiguchi, Daisuke Sakamoto, H.

We suggest that they should consider how the integration system extends the user's abilities in the contexts of the experience. Using EEG to monitor neural activity can offer access to a user's preattentive processing state, resulting in possibilities for integration where the system responds to a situation \"before\" the user can with their body. This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_metadata": "Authors: Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, D.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

This paper proposes a new multi-axis modeling to better capture the temporal structure of events. In addition, we identify that event end-points are a major source of confusion in annotation, so we also propose to annotate TempRels based on start-points only. A pilot expert annotation effort using the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in IAA from the conventional 60\u2019s to 80\u2019s (Cohen\u2019s Kappa). This better-defined annotation scheme further enables the use of crowdsourcing to alleviate the labor intensity for each annotator.

And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks.

Text segmentation (Hearst, 1994;Choi, 2000;Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008;Koshorek et al., 2018) is another well studied discourse analysis task that aims to divide a text into a sequence of topically coherent segments and has been shown useful for text summarization (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), sentiment analysis (Sauper et al., 2010) and dialogue systems (Shi et al., 2019). The news discourse profiling task is complementary to the well-established discourse analysis tasks and is likely to further benefit many NLP applications. First, it studies genre-specific discourse structures, while the aforementioned discourse analysis tasks study genre independent general discourse structures and thus fail to incorporate domain knowledge. Second, it focuses on understanding global content organization structures with the main event at the center, while the existing tasks focus on either understanding rhetorical aspects of discourse structures (RST and PDTB discourse parsing) or detecting shallow topic transition structures (text segmentation).", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_metadata": "Authors: Arjun Reddy Akula, Spandana Gella, Keze Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Siva Reddy | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours. Other related work on predicting aspect include systems aiming at identifying lexical aspect (Siegel and McKeown, 2000;Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) or habituals (Mathew and Katz, 2009;Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015).", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_4": "Several systems (Milne and Witten, 2008;Kulkarni et al., 2009;Hoffart et al., 2011) use the \"Milne and Witten\" measure for relatedness between a pair of entities, which is based on the number of Wikipedia articles citing each entity page, and the number of articles citing both; Cucerzan (2007) has also relied on the Wikipedia category structure. Internal links from one entity page to another in Wikipedia also provide direct evidence of relatedness between them. Another (possibly more noisy) source of information are Web pages containing links (Singh et al., 2012) to Wikipedia pages of both entities.

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows.

LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining robustness of models\u2019 ability to deploy relevant context information in the face of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Systematic comparison of interference effects in humans and in language models stands to shed light on mechanistic similarities and differences in the ways that these language processing systems handle information from prior context.", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

As a starting point we rely on models' ability to display this type of knowledge, but our question differs importantly from that work: we are not asking whether models can recall facts about the real world from training-rather, we are trying to gauge the extent to which models form robust representations of new information presented in input after training. Somewhat more similar to ours is work like Elazar et al. (2021), which explores the consistency of models' generation of facts in the face of rephrasing of prompts. The basic intuition behind this work-that LMs' ability to make intelligent-looking predictions can be sensitive to the particulars of the context-is one that we also use as we ask more specific questions about models' processing of information in their input.", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled.

Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak.

In the future, we will quantitatively model how the estimated trend is related to these proxies and to model a larger set of mark shapes and sizes. Since participants might have used diferent strategies for dealing with outliers (e.g., considering or discarding) in Experiment 2, the efects of outliers are likely to difer based on the individual strategy . In the future, we will model individual diferences and preform a secondary analysis of the experimental data as did by Kay and Heer [15].

Das et al. (2017a) proposed a visual dialog task in which a conversational agent attempts to answer questions regarding an assigned image based on a dialog history. To approach this task, they initially collected data by having two people chat about an image with one person acting as the questioner and the other as the answerer. GuessWhich (Chattopadhyay et al., 2017) extends VisDial with the goal to build an agent that learns how to identify a target image through question and answers. (de Vries et al., 2016) additionally introduced a game in which a series of yes-or-no questions are asked by an agent in order to locate an object in an image. Many researchers approached these tasks via reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of obtaining an optimal dialog policy. Zhang et al. (2017), for example, designed three rewards with respect to the goals of task achievement, efficiency, and question informativeness, in order to help the agent to achieve an effective question generation policy for GuessWhat game. Das et al. (2017b) applies reinforcement learning in the GuessWhich task and demonstrates a moderate improvement in accuracy compared to the supervised learning approach. Both methods apply RL on a neural end-to-end pipeline to jointly influence the language generation and dialog policy. Due the challenge of designing an appropriate reward for language generation, these methods generate responses that deviate from human natural language. Zhang et al. (2018), proposed an approach involving hierarchical reinforcement learning and state-adaptation techniques that enable the agent to learn an optimal and efficient multi-modal policy. The bottleneck of (Zhang et al., 2018)'s method, however, is that the system response is retrieved from a predefined humanwritten or system-generated utterance. The number of predefined responses are limited, therefore, this method does not easily generalize to other tasks in real-world settings. We address these limitations by applying RL on a reduced, yet more relevant action space, while optimizing the dialog generator in a supervised fashion. We alternatively optimize policy learning to language generation to combine the two tasks together.", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_para_1": "Dialogue generation is an important research topic in NLP, thus many approaches have been proposed to address this task. Most earlier works made use of a predefined template (Lemon et al., 2006;Wang and Lemon, 2013) to generate dialogues. More recently, deep neural networks have been used for building end-to-end architectures capable of generating questions (Vinyals and Le, 2015;Sordoni et al., 2015) and also for the task of goal-oriented dialogue generation (Rajendran et al., 2018;Bordes et al., 2017). Visual dialogue focuses on having a conversation about an image with either one or both of the agents being a machine. Since its inception (Das et al., 2017), different approaches have been proposed to address this problem (Massiceti et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2017;Das et al., 2017). Goaloriented Visual Dialogue, on the other hand, is an area that has only been introduced fairly recently. De Vries et al.  proposed the GuessWhat?! dataset for goal-oriented visual dialogue while Strub et al.  developed a reinforcement learning approach for Figure 2: A block diagram of our model. The framework is trained on top of three individual models: the questioner (QGen), the guesser, and the oracle. The guesser returns an object distribution given a history of question-answer pairs that are generated by the questioner and the oracle respectively. These distributions are used for calculating the information gain of the question-answer pair. The information gain and distribution of probabilities given by the Guesser are used either as a reward or optimized as a loss function with global rewards for training the questioner.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_para_1": "Various RL-based models have been proposed to train task-oriented dialog systems (Williams and Young, 2007). In order to build a traditional modular-based dialog system, researchers first identify the semantic representation, such as the dialog acts and slots in user utterances. Then they accumulate these semantic representations over time to track the dialog state. Finally they apply RL to learn an optimized dialog policy given the dialog state (Raux et al., 2005;Shi and Yu, 2018). Such modular-based dialog systems are effective in narrow task domains, such as searching a bus route schedule and reserving a restaurant through natural language, but they fail to generalize to complex settings where the size of the action space increases. Owing to the development of deep learning, RL on neural sequence-to-sequence models has been explored in more complex dialog domains such as open-domain conversation (Li et al., 2016) and negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017). However, due to the difficulty of assigning appropriate rewards when operating in a large action space, these frameworks cannot generate fluent dialog utterances. Zhao et al. (2019) proposed a novel latent action RL framework to marry the advantage of a module based approach and sequence-to-sequence approach. They learned the optimal dialog policy in a complex task-oriented dialog domain while achieving decent conversation quality. We study the similar issue in a multimodal task-oriented dialog scenario. We propose an iterative approach to optimize dialog policy using RL methods and system response generation via SL.

More specifically, our focus lies on how humans come up with a series of questions in order to reach a particular goal. One popular theory suggests that humans try to maximize the expected regularized information gain while asking questions (Hawkins et al., 2015;Coenen et al., 2017). Motivated by that, we evaluate the utility of using information gain for goal-oriented visual question generation with a reinforcement learning paradigm. In this paper, we propose two different approaches for training an end-to-end architecture: first, a novel reward function that is a trade-off between the expected information gain of a question and the cost of asking it; and second, a loss function that uses regularized information gain with a step-based reward function. Our architecture is able to generate goal-oriented questions without using any prior templates.

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image.

Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

After an in-depth engagement with and critical reading of the literature, and several subsequent rounds of discussion among co-authors, we argue that there is sufficient agreement among scholars on the Deliberative discourse Argument is part of theory (+) Argument is not part of theory (-) fact-related argument [18,20,49,62,85] we vs. them [20] structured argument [18,62,85,103] generalized call for action [62,85,129] counterargument [20,58] who instead of what [20,62] empathy/reciprocity [20,131] emotional language [20,58,62] unsupported argument [20,58,62] Civic discourse Argument is part of theory (+) Argument is not part of theory (-) situational call for action [2,24,35,110] fact-related argument [12,35,89] we vs. them [24,35,82,89] structured argument [12,35,89] counterargument [12,89] generalized call for action [2,35] empathy/reciprocity [12,35,89,131] emotional language [12,35,89,131] collective rhetoric [24,35,89] Demagogic discourse Argument is part of theory (+) Argument is not part of theory (-) you in the epicenter [57,78] fact-related argument [57,101,102] we vs. them [63,102] structured argument [57,101,102] generalized call for action [63,102] empathy/reciprocity [57,78] who instead of what [57] counterargument [101,102] emotional language [57,101] unsupported argument [57,101] collective rhetoric [57,63,102] essential components of each type of political discourse to train a classifier that is able to discriminate among them. Developing the corresponding set of labels was a cyclical rather than a linear process. After critical engagement with the cited literature on the three political discourse theories, two co-authors separately developed codes based on their analysis of the most essential components of each political discourse theory. Then, they compared the created categories and, with the aid of a third co-author, agreed on an initial set of components. Through multiple rounds of discussion, two co-authors assigned the essential components to each of the three discourse theories. This process led to further discussion on the definitional scope of the components. Thus, through multiple rounds of discussion between three co-authors, going back and forth between the choices of essential components and their assignment to the three discourse theories, we finally agreed on thirteen essential components that could be operationalized in a multilabel classification task (see final set of components together with their definitions in Appendix B & Table 5). We document disagreement among co-authors on the definition and assignment of some of the components in Appendix B (see Fact-related argument in Appendix B.3 and Identity Labels in Appendix B.8). Table 1 presents an overview of the essential components and how we assigned them to each political discourse theory for our multilabel classification task.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

An example is provided by the debate on Facebook's policy on users' personal data: their policy was justifed in the name of the free, valuable service it provided but also criticized in the name of transparency [41]. Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy. A controversy is an issue that can inspire opposite positions and can be framed within opposite categories [3], [21], [29], [57]. In our case, the cyberattack represents the controversy, i.e., a behavior that can be framed either favorably or unfavorably.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_19": "The CFA's results reveal that there is a clear connection between theory and social media discussions, and also show which key rhetoric components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse describe user interactions in our sample (RQ1). Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_metadata": "Authors: Yice Zhang, Yifan Yang, Yihui Li, Bin Liang, Shiwei Chen, Yixue Dang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

Several commercial engines such as the IBM Watson [28], CereVoice [4], and Nuance Loquendo [18] allow for the rendering of emotional synthesized speech. Each of these systems is similar in allowing developers to select between a small set of emotional categories when rendering speech (e.g., CereVoice supports a default voice in addition to \"happy,\" \"sad,\" \"calm,\" and \"cross\"). Recent developments on the MaryTTS engine (an open-source TTS research platform) [14] have extended beyond simply accepting the specification of emotional categories, allowing for emotional tones to be specified with continuous values for emotional dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance [5]. In addition to allowing for the high-level specification of a tone of voice, each of these TTS engines also supports low-level speech modifications through the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2].

In this paper, we propose a joint contrastive learning (JointCL) framework, which consists of stance contrastive learning and target-aware prototypical graph contrastive learning. Specifically, a stance contrastive learning strategy is employed to better generalize stance features for unseen targets. Further, we build a prototypical graph for each instance to learn the target-based representation, in which the prototypes are deployed as a bridge to share the graph structures between the known targets and the unseen ones. Then a novel target-aware prototypical graph contrastive learning strategy is devised to generalize the reasoning ability of target-based stance representations to the unseen targets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ZSSD task.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_2": "Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stance for destination unseen targets by learning stance features from known targets (Allaway and McKeown, 2020).

It can be observed from the experimental results, our proposed JointCL framework performs consistently better than the non-BERT and the BERTbased comparison models on both the VAST and WT-WT datasets, and achieves overall better performance than the comparison baselines on the SEM16 dataset. This verifies the effectiveness of our JointCL framework in the ZSSD task. Furthermore, the significance tests of JointCL over the baseline models show that our JointCL significantly outperforms the baseline models (the results of p\u2212value on most of the evaluation metrics are less than 0.05). More concretely, in comparison with the adversarial learning-based model (TOAD), our JointCL achieves significant improvement across all datasets.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model. As expected, performance is lower on the Live Chat Customer Service corpus.", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_metadata": "Authors: Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Zhihao Fan, Zengfeng Huang, Weijian Sun, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

There have been several proposals to alleviate this issue with, for instance, self-supervised learning techniques, but they still require human-annotated corpora. In this work, we explore the unsupervised learning paradigm which can potentially work with unlabeled text corpora that are cheaper and easier to obtain. Our model builds upon the recent work on Noisy Student Training, a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the idea of self-training. Experimental results on the commonly used English Switchboard test set show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art supervised systems using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. BERT and ELECTRA).", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_para_6": "Heike Adel and Hinrich Sch\u00fctze. 2017.

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_metadata": "Authors: Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Roberto Navigli | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b)."}}

We replicate findings that women are dramatically under-represented as OSM contributors, and observe that men and women contribute different types of content and do so about different places.

Our results support the hypothesis that men and women tend to contribute diferent types of content. We observe this both in terms of the regions where men and women edit (e.g., rural vs. urban) and in terms of the type of content that they contribute (e.g., the specifc spatial entities they add to the database). However, our results also reveal critical complexity in these diferences that belie a simple gender-based self-focus bias interpretation [65,68,92]. In particular, we observed that men disproportionately contribute to entities that critical geographers [65,92] have identifed as being in feminized spaces and women disproportionately contribute entities in masculinized spaces.

Throughout the paper, by \"edit\" we refer to different mapping activities, such as adding a node, modifying locations, adding or altering tags, etc. In OSM, editors often use automated software agents (i.e., bots) and automationassisted batch editors to bulk import pre-existing data. For example, data have been imported in bulk to OSM from the U.S. government's TIGER/Line Street datasets. 'Bot edits' are often not regarded as volunteered human activity [55,83]. To detect bot changeset 2 edits, we used fles downloaded from planet.osm [4]. Following prior work [55,83,99,100], we marked edits as 'bot edits' when they came from a changeset containing edits in very large quantities (more than 4,000 edits) or at a very fast rate (more than one edit per second).

Users can interactively refine the layout by resolving ambiguity and adding constraints. While these techniques assist with grid design and alignment, layout construction is left to the designer.

Within the area of combinatorial geometry, grid layout has been studied in the context of 2D bin packing [37,42,50], rectangular packing [27], and the guillotine cuts problem [11]. An elementary version of the grid design problem has been previously proposed [27], but it merely attempts to find the most densely packed solution whereby the elements are squeezed together as closely as possible; there is no attempt to address aesthetics (like alignment) and no intent to explore multiple layouts. Optimisation has been used for resizing GUI elements [60], with the focus being on improving aesthetics of a layout by making subtle changes when the available space is varied. Previous research has also looked into generating optimised grid-based layouts. AIDE is a metrics-based tool to aid design and evaluation of UIs [52]. It included objectives such as balance, efficiency, and constraints. The optimiser computed a layout grid and used this to organise widgets. ADL is a layout engine that dynamically constructed grid layouts [3]. Given static elements, it filled up the remaining area with dynamic content . Typically, these approaches compute a single point-optimal solution. Following earlier findings, we believe it is necessary to present designers with a diverse range of solutions [2,55]. However, random-search based optimisation methods do not support generation of controllably diverse results. IP-based approaches have been previously used to generate, for example, keyboard layouts [32]. This allows for a structured search process and guaranteed bounds, thus improving outcomes and increasing designer confidence. More recently, AdaM employed IP to distribute UIs in multi-user environments [48]. While the formulation does address limited display size, the objectives, constraints, and applications differ substantially from ours.", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_para_6": "Computational techniques have been proposed for designing layouts with designer in the loop. DesignScape [45] supports enhancement and exploration of single-page layouts using energy-based optimisation. The design principles here are limited to those learnt from a small set of examples, and optimisation is computationally-expensive. Sketchplorer [55] supports exploring, enhancing, and recolouring layouts. However, it employs black-box optimisation on a discrete canvas, which does not scale, resulting in poor performance for complex design tasks. Moreover, it does not address objectives of good grid layouts, such as rectangularity, alignment, or preferential placement. Genetic algorithms have been used to iteratively select promising interfaces from a collection of candidates [16]. Various constraints had to be placed to prevent inappropriate groupings in the layout, and to reduce the number of selections. Data-driven approaches enable layout generation without requiring problem specification [36,62]. However, results are limited to the domain of the training dataset, and offer no quality guarantees. In what comes close to our aims, a semi-automatic grid-based technique has been previously proposed [29]. Here, users constructed an example layout, which, as in this paper, was represented as an algorithmic task to generate layouts of any size. New examples were presented to the user, enabling them to steer the generation.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_para_5": "In this section, we present an extension to the ancestral sampling algorithm of Colbourn et al.

However, their design is largely time consuming manual work. This is challenging due to combinatorial explosion and complex objectives, such as alignment, balance, and expectations regarding positions. This paper proposes a novel optimisation approach for the generation of diverse grid-based layouts. Our mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model offers a rigorous yet efficient method for grid generation that ensures packing, alignment, grouping, and preferential positioning of elements. Further, we present techniques for interactive diversification, enhancement, and completion of grid layouts. These capabilities are demonstrated using GRIDS, a wireframing tool that provides designers with real-time layout suggestions. We report findings from a ratings study (N = 13) and a design study (N = 16), lending evidence for the benefit of computational grid generation during early stages of design.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_metadata": "Authors: Yice Zhang, Yifan Yang, Yihui Li, Bin Liang, Shiwei Chen, Yixue Dang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_metadata": "Authors: R.

Access to diverse but relevant computationally generated suggestions could help them in exploring and enhancing designs [55], thus avoiding too early fixation [9]. Moreover, need for manual editing could be reduced if computer-generated designs were able to suggest completions to partially finalised designs. However, the algorithmic problems involved are non-trivial. Any such method must efficiently search within a very vast design space while reacting to real-time changes made by the designer. Prior to this work, it has not been known how to best define core features of a good grid layout. The more design objectives and concerns one can incorporate into the mathematical system, the less final editing is left to the designer. However, it is not known how to combine objectives that together ensure performant and aesthetically pleasing layouts.

Layout constraints can define bounds on elements, or relationship between elements. A constraint solver manipulates element properties to best satisfy the specified constraints. One method is to solve layout constraints incrementally [17]. It can satisfy changing constraint hierarchies consisting of hard and soft constraints in an efficient manner. Relational grammars can be further added to encode design knowledge [57]. This can address the logical composition of elements during layout generation. Chorus [28] addressed non-linear geometric constraints such as Euclidean geometric, non-overlapping, and graph layout constraints. It also discussed soft constraints with hierarchical strengths or preferences. Cassowary [1] implemented a linear arithmetic constraint solver to adapt layout to changing sizes. This has also been implemented in some commercial systems such as Apple's Auto Layout 2 , enabling GUIs to dynamically adjust their layouts when window or screen dimensions changed. A benefit of constraint solving is that a layout can be defined by means of simple constraints. On the other hand, specifying a layout fully using just constraints quickly becomes complex [61]. To our knowledge, no constraints-based method has been proposed that ensures proper packing of elements and takes care of objectives like alignment, rectangularity, and grouping. Lacking this, designers may need to modify layouts manually or fix remaining aspects programmatically.", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_metadata": "Authors: Devamardeep Hayatpur, Haijun Xia, Daniel J.

Based on this finding, we suggest existing communities should educate members to try to understand the intent of the contributors and provide constructive suggestions when conflicts occur. The online collaboration systems should also support flexible interfaces for members to conveniently provide suggestions. In Wikipedia, newcomers' edits are often reverted without any further information. According to Halfaker's paper [17], this might be a cause of the slower growth of Wikipedia's editor base. They then proposed a tool to present newcomers' activity traces to Wikipedian mentors, and this information significantly helped mentors to provide more explanations about edit reverts [18]. However, our results suggest that tools should be designed to support not just providing explanations but also giving constructive suggestions for solving the problem in order to retain good-faith contributors.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_para_4": "Conflicts occur frequently in online collaboration settings due to a lack of shared context, limited information sharing channels, and weak interpersonal bonds between members [20]. Conflicts are especially common in the peer review process, in which people decide whether one's contributions should be accepted or not [42]. There are different forms of peer review in different online collaboration settings. In many software development projects, there is a formal peer review system where contributors propose code changes (e.g., pull-requests in GitHub) and reviewers decide whether the contribution should be accepted or not [40]. In Wikipedia, both formal peer review and informal peer review exists. For instance, featured articles (FA) are determined by a formal peer review process where group of editors decide whether candidate articles should be promoted to FA or not [1]. Additionally, any edit on Wikipedia articles could be viewed as being informally \"peer reviewed\" [37]. On most unprotected pages, any editors can \"review\" others' edits. If they don't like the edits, they can reject them by reverting or overwriting on them. In this paper, we focus on formal peer review systems where there are explicit roles like reviewers and submitters (which we refer as contributors in the following sections), and dedicated places to submit the review, discuss the review decision. Particularly, we examine what happens when the submitter openly disagrees with the reviewers (i.e., conflicts occur).", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_para_0": "Online open collaboration projects rely on large groups of volunteer contributors to collectively produce important artifacts or services. Peer review is an important mechanism to ensure quality of the products [33]. Because of the large variance in background, viewpoints and experience among contributors, conflicts often arise in the peer review process, specifically as disagreements over whether a particular contribution should be accepted [42]. For example, Joode et al. found that both task conflict and affective conflict can occur in open source communities, especially when a contributor's software patch was unjustly rejected [41].", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_metadata": "Authors: Jiahuan Zheng, Xin Peng, Jiacheng Yang, Huaqian Cai, Gang Huang, Ying Zhang, Wenyun Zhao | Venue: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work | Year: 2017 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_para_1": "Conflicts generally have negative effects on group loyalty, work productivity, and job satisfaction [10,19,21].

Furthermore, conflicts originally concerning the task itself can evolve into interpersonal or affective conflicts [6,15]. This can lead to negative emotions such as feelings of disappointment, frustration, annoyance and anger, which also cause contributors to leave the community. Unlike traditional organizations, contributors of online collaboration projects have no formal employment or membership contacts with the community, so they can easily leave the communities with few social or economic consequences. Based on the above reasoning, we propose our first hypothesis: H1: Contributors who have conflicts with other members in the community are more likely to leave the community than those who don't have conflicts with other members.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_metadata": "Authors: Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Zhihao Fan, Zengfeng Huang, Weijian Sun, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

To explore whether a similar game could be used to study computer-mediated interaction and as an ice-breaker activity to increase affiliation in remote collaboration, we developed a multiplayer online mouse coordination game inspired by the mirror game. The source code to the game is released as free open source software.", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_metadata": "Authors: Teresa Almeida, R.

Colnago et al. [14] documented the attitudes and behaviors surrounding twofactor authentication (2FA) as it was rolled out at a large research university. Regarding account sharing, the authors found that 2FA interfered with the ability of some students to share their financial accounts with parents, because the parents could only use the shared password at a time when the students were available to answer the 2FA push notification. They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities. They found that about half did not make their security policies publicly accessible, and that these policies were seldom consistent or shared source materials; moreover, the policies tended to be difficult to read, lacking in emotional language, and worded ambiguously and/or tentatively, such that the takeaways were unclear.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

recently been adopted for use within the domain of visual analytics because it can provide users with an endless workspace within which they can be actively engaged and use their spatial reasoning skills for data analysis. However, virtual worlds need to utilize layouts and organizational schemes that are meaningful to the user and beneficial for data analysis. This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_title": "On Looking at the Vagina through Labella", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_para_0": "Populating large environments with virtual content is a challenge, however, without effective navigation techniques, users will not be able to explore content quickly and easily in these environments.

This phase included (i) analyzing design details of digital haat websites (both governmental and non-governmental), (ii) observing and documenting comments, conversations, and debates on Facebook pages that were used as online trading platforms for cattle heads, (iii) conducting 15 semi-structured phone-interviews with online cattle sellers (6, men, 21-45 yrs old, 5 received formal education) and buyers (6 men, 3 women, age ranged from 25 to 53 yrs, working individuals). We approached our participants through our social network. Interviews were 20-30 minutes long and focused on the participants' experience around digital selling/shopping of Qurbani animals.

Since the ethnographer was born and raised in a Muslim family in Dhaka, she was familiar with the Qurbani rituals and urban engagements with this festival from her childhood. She visited, observed, and documented urban spatial transformations of six residential areas in Dhaka, including Arambag, Shantinagar, Shahjahanpur, Badda, Khilgaon, and Gulshan Niketon. We chose these areas to ensure socio-economic diversities in the study. On Eid day, we documented Qurbani rituals (from slaughtering to meat distribution) at six residential buildings in Arambag and Shantinagar residential areas. we also conducted short interviews with 1 Imam (leads Muslim worshipers in prayer in the local mosque, 35yrs old, male), 4 meat processors (26-35 yrs old, male, original occupation rickshaw pulling), and 6 needy meat collectors (21-40 yrs old, 2 male, 4 female, beggars) on the Eid day. As the last step of this phase, we conducted FGDs with 15 afuent Muslim families (2-5 adult members in each family, including men and women) from the above-mentioned residential areas. We approached all of them through our social network, and they participated voluntarily to share their experiences with us. We asked about their family traditions around this religious event, their urban engagements at neighborhood and city level during Eid, and the infuence of the emerging digital cattle markets on their ritual, among others.

Prior implementations of NMN use pre-defined and fixed textual inputs in their module instantiation. This necessitates a large number of modules as they lack the ability to share weights and exploit associations between similar textual contexts (e.g. \u201cdark cube on the left\u201d vs. \u201cblack cube on the left\u201d). In this work, we address these limitations and evaluate the impact of contextual clues in improving the performance of NMN models. First, we address the problem of fixed textual inputs by parameterizing the module arguments. This substantially reduce the number of modules in NMN by up to 75% without any loss in performance. Next we propose a method to contextualize our parameterized model to enhance the module\u2019s capacity in exploiting the visiolinguistic associations. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art NMN model on CLEVR-Ref+ dataset with +8.1% improvement in accuracy on the single-referent test set and +4.3% on the full test set. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextualization provides +11.2% and +1.7% improvements in accuracy over prior NMN models on CLOSURE and NLVR2. We further evaluate the impact of our contextualization by constructing a contrast set for CLEVR-Ref+, which we call CC-Ref+. We significantly outperform the baselines by as much as +10.4% absolute accuracy on CC-Ref+, illustrating the generalization skills of our approach.", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_2": "Moreover, in the prior implementations of NMN such as IEP-Ref (Johnson et al., 2017b;Liu et al., 2019), the modules in execution engine are not conditioned on the surrounding context of their textual input in the expression. This is problematic as the modules are not given the opportunity to watch the neighborhood of textual input that helps in extracting the informative visiolinguistic context from the module's visual input. For example, the module filter_color[dark] needs to pick a black colored cube or a red-colored cube depending on the neighborhood context in the expression (e.g. \"the dark thing that is hardly visible\" vs. \"the dark thing among the red cubes\") and the type of cubes available in its visual input. Few implementations of NMN such as FiLM (Perez et al., 2018) and N2NMN (Hu et al., 2017a) parametrize the surrounding context of their textual input. However, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow as they cannot jointly co-attend over potential objects of interest directly from the visual input and textual inputs.", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_4": "Neural Module Networks. Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse textual expressions as executable programs composed of learnable neural modules (Andreas et al., 2016b;Johnson et al., 2017a,b;Hu et al., 2017a). Each of these modules are specialized to compute basic reasoning tasks and can be assembled to perform complex and compositional reasoning. (Andreas et al., 2016b) used dependency trees (Zhu et al., 2013) to generate the execution layouts. (Andreas et al., 2016a) proposed dynamic NMNs that learns and adapts the structure of the execution layouts to the question.

IEP model achieves promising performance on CLEVR dataset. (Liu et al., 2019) proposed IEP-Ref by extending IEP model to CLEVR-Ref+ dataset and outperformed all the prior works. Although, compositional by design, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow and fail to ground novel combinations of known linguistic constructs (Bahdanau et al., 2019). The major difference between our work and these prior works of NMN is that we explicitly parametrize and contextualize the neural modules by jointly attending over the visual and textual inputs.

However, such a design demands a large number of learnable modules (and network parameters) and they cannot share weights for similar contextual textual inputs (e.g. 'dark cube' vs. 'black cube', 'shiny cylinder' vs. 'metallic cylinder').

RePlay could naturally be extended to any textual content (or content with textual metadata). Text results could be displayed as short summaries with clickable keywords to expand more detail [13]. For detecting context, RePlay used MacOS's accessibility api; other oss (e.g. Windows [34]) also have similar apis. Beyond software, RePlay's approach could extend to any domain for which online videos are abundant (e.g., physical building tasks). To detect activity context, one could augment physical tools with sensors [31,46] or track body poses with wearable sensors or computer vision.

In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining robustness of models\u2019 ability to deploy relevant context information in the face of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_abstract": "Complex activities often require people to work across multiple software applications.

RePlay uses accessibility APIs to gather context about the user's activity. It leverages an existing search engine to present relevant videos and highlights key segments within them using video captions.

The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31]. Users tend to rely more on anticipation (their internal clock) than on reaction when the task becomes more difficult. Although simple, the model adequately addresses two quite different cases:", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A. Globerson, N. Lazic, Soumen Chakrabarti, A.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

systems, slot filling requires extensive training data in a certain domain. However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch).

The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network.

Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_7": "Previous work has also shown the possibility to detect or localize a finger/finger-tap using active sensing methods, which use infrared [4], electrical [57,60], magnetic [8] or acoustic signals [35,54]. These approaches typically involve active transmission of a signal from a transmitter node and then analyzing the reception of that signal at the receiver node. FingerIO [35], for example, transforms the device into an active sonar system that transmits inaudible sound signals and tracks the echoes of the finger at its microphones. We investigated an active sensing approach, but there are fundamental constraints in the physics of this approach (detailed later in Discussion).", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_metadata": "Authors: A.

Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_metadata": "Authors: Jennifer G.

Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20]. Nonetheless, our techniques require wearing multiple rings to track the motions of secondary fingers, which may be somewhat impractical for some users. This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements. For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_metadata": "Authors: Kagonya Awori, M.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

Popular CUIs, e.g., Alexa, are changing the way we converse, narrate, and imagine the world(s) to come. Yet, current conversational interactions normatively may promote non-desirable ends, delivering a restricted range of request-response interactions with sexist and digital colonialist tendencies. Our critical design approach envisions alternatives by considering how future voices can reside in CUIs as enabling probes. We present novel explorations that illustrate the potential of CUIs as critical design material, by critiquing present norms and conversing with imaginary species. As micro-level interventions, we show that conversations with diverse futures through CUIs can persuade us to critically shape our discourse on macro-scale concerns of the present, e.g., sustainability. We reflect on how conversational interactions with pluralistic, imagined futures can contribute to how being human stands to change.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_metadata": "Authors: R.

However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_7": "However, the bias introduced by data-driven marks is small when the trend line is more certain. This is the case if the residual bandwidth is small, outliers are far away from the major cluster or have diferent densities, or if the intermingled clusters have radically diferent slopes. In such cases there is little ambiguity in the trend, and so estimates are accurate even without guidance from mark orientation. Implications for Scatterplot Design. The above fndings suggest that mark orientation can be a visual cue to implicitly encode trend information. A trend line directly encodes the model in a dogmatic way, whereas data-driven marks act as less dogmatic guidance that can be ignored or downweighted when they seem inappropriate or are clearly at odds with the depicted data, functioning as a form of \"implicit uncertainty visualization\" [6]. We have shown viewers will, in their own visual estimates, ignore things like outliers that would be a problem for explicit trend lines based on models of insufcient complexity. Fig. 19 shows how data-driven marks could be used to disambiguate trends in a health care dataset for investigating how the blood pressure is related to sodium excretion [11]. We can see that the slopes of the OLS trend and the robust trend have opposing signs (see Fig. 19(a)). Using data-driven marks can suggest a resolution to this ambiguity for the reviewer by downweight (b) or reinforcing (c) the contribution of the outlying points to the overall trend. Although it is hard to make a fair comparison between such implicit and explicit trend visualizations (for instance, Correll & Heer [7] believed that participants would adhere to explicit trend lines so closely if present that they used such stimuli as action checks), we believe that data-driven orientation can assist in regression by eye, especially for cases where standard models like OLS are inappropriate, or there are multiple valid interpretations of the data (as in Xiong et al. [34]).", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_6": "Initial work from Correll & Heer [7] suggests that people are able to perform a general sort of \"regression by eye\" with simple Gaussian stimuli and a single class of outliers. However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_2": "(1) Mark orientation would have a strong efect on trend estimation: an orientation consistent with the trend direction results in a higher accuracy. In other words, we expect mark shapes to guide or bias the estimates of the participants. Prior work indicates that carefully designed mark orientation can direct the perception of cluster structures in scatterplots [3,17]. (2) The efect of mark orientation on trend accuracy would be most pronounced when residual bandwidth was large: that is, a small bandwidth would result in similar accuracy for diferent marks, while a large bandwidth would result in large diferences in accuracy across diferent marks. Prior work [7,21] shows that the dispersion of points infuences accuracy in trend and correlation judgments, with very high accuracy when dispersion from the trend is small. Insofar as we anticipated that mark orientation would guide or bias participants in their estimates, we suspected that the impact of this guidance would be less pronounced for stimuli where the dispersion is low and so accuracy is high in any event.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_3": "(1) Mark orientation would afect trend estimation: we believed that a mark orientation consistent with the robust trend line would encourage participants to ignore or otherwise downweight outliers. As with the prior experiment an prior work [3,17], we anticipated that marks orientation might bias or guide judgments. (2) The distance between outliers and the major cluster would afect trend estimation: as the distance between outlier cluster and major point cluster centroids increased, we anticipated that participants would downweight the outlying clusters when making their estimates. Prior work shows that participants downweight (but did not entirely discount) outliers when performing trend estimation [7], although only with very distance outliers. We wanted to explore the placement of outliers in greater detail. (3) The density diference between outliers and major trend has a signifcant efect: with increasing density diference between main trend and outliers, participants would more easily ignore outliers. Previous research indicates that density diference afects human judgments in visual clustering [23].", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_8": "Our interview results show that participants report that they estimate trends by combining bounding boxes and local densities. Many of our participants reported mentally drawing a bounding box for all points, and then removing outliers. Since the trend is not strictly determined by these perceptual proxies [14,18], we cannot directly compute how these global or local visual structures were used. In the future, we will quantitatively model how the estimated trend is related to these proxies and to model a larger set of mark shapes and sizes. Since participants might have used diferent strategies for dealing with outliers (e.g., considering or discarding) in Experiment 2, the efects of outliers are likely to difer based on the individual strategy . In the future, we will model individual diferences and preform a secondary analysis of the experimental data as did by Kay and Heer [15]. In addition, we are particularly interested in how the mark size (and its infuence on visual artifacts like overplotting and occlusion) could skew assessments of local density and the resulting estimated trend. We are also interested in expanding our study of data-driven orientation to wider use cases, especially under additional \"adversarial\" scatterplot conditions [18] (such as marks with transparency, high degrees of overplotting, nonlinear or non-uniform trends, or where likely perceptual proxies like bounding boxes are uninformative).", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_4": "We performed a repeated measures rANOVA analysis for understanding fve factors: number of outliers, mark shape, outlier distance to the major cluster, outlier location, as well as outlier density. For analyzing the efect of the outlier distance, we computed all stimuli and then quantized them into fve nonuniform groups based on the ratio of cluster centroid distance and the correlation of main cluster. In the supplementary materials we discuss other factors for which we did not have strong or relevant hypotheses. Mark Orientation. In accordance to our hypothesis, mark orientation had a signifcant efect on the accuracy of the estimations for trend orientation (F (3, 210) = 5.06, p < .05) and trend intercept (F (3, 216) = 5.86, p < .001). As shown in Fig. 10, marks pointing towards the direction of the robust trend (Tri-R) created less error with respect to the robust trend. Similarly, marks pointing towards the full OLS line (Tri-O) produced less error with respect to this line, while the other two marks perform similarly. Our results also support the fnding of Correll & Heer [7] that participants downweighted outlying points when making trend estimates. For the following analyses we therefore used the robust trend line as our basis of comparison. Results for estimating intercepts can be found in the supplemental materials. Outlier Distance. Corresponding to our hypothesis, outlying clusters further away from the remaining points were considered less important for trend estimation. With increasing distance of the outlying cluster our participants produced estimations closer to the robust trend line. We observed that the distance had an extremely signifcant efect on the estimation accuracy with respect to the robust trend orientation (F (4, 284) = 27.94, p < .0001) and the intercept (F (4, 293) = 29.03, p < .0001).

While there exists a vast palette of potential mark shape options for which we would anticipate difering patterns of perceptual judgments [8], we focus on triangles and circles, which are the most widely used marks. For example, over 97% of all single-class scatterplots in the VizNet [13] dataset use one of those two mark types. Besides a default upward oriented orientation, we test triangles rotated using data-driven factors, with circles as a default option without inherent orientation. We also found that most triangle marks in VizNet [13] dataset are equilateral triangles; thus, while isosceles triangles have less ambiguity in their encoding of orientation, we use equilateral triangles. Additionally, unlike isosceles triangles, the exact center of equilateral triangles is easier to estimate, which might have benefts for distributional estimation tasks.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_metadata": "Authors: Jiapeng Wang, Lianwen Jin, Kai Ding | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

Specifcally, we frst created a Set A with 40 points, slope of \u03b2 = 1 and residual bandwidth of \u03c3 = 0. Here, we only analyzed 4 slopes instead of 8 (positive and negative) for two reasons: i) we had already studied efect of trend slope sign on trend estimation in our previous experiments and had no strong hypotheses around an interaction with cluster density (see Fig. 7) and ii) mixing a positive trend in Set A with a negative trend in Set B can only produce small regions with non-uniform densities. The number of total stimuli was therefore 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 = 96 stimuli plus 4 additional validation stimuli synthesized by Eq. 1 as attention checks for this experiment. Fig. 13 shows six examples generated by merging the green and orange point sets with overlaid green and orange trend lines. Figs. 13(a,b,c) demonstrate that changing the number of points in one set with a fxed slope infuences the perceived density. On the other hand, changing the trend slope while keeping the number of points unchanged infuences the bounding boxes, as shown in Figs. 13(d,e,f). Since bounding boxes are an efcient visual proxy for the perception of the correlations in scatterplots [36], we speculated that the size of the bounding box might also impact the visual estimates of the trends. Note that the colors used in Fig. 13 are for illustrative purposes only, Fig. 14 shows an example stimuli used in the experiment. Mark Orientation. As with the prior experiments, we used static marks (circles and Tri-Up) as well as a set of marks with data-driven orientations. In this case, the triangle marks were rotated towards the orientation of the trend of Set A (Tri-A) or Set B (Tri-B), which serves as the upper or lower bound of the orientation of the user ft. In particular, Tri-A was fxed with 45 \u2022 , while the orientation of Tri-B was a value in the set of {5.7 \u2022 , 11.3 \u2022 , 21.8 \u2022 , 38.7 \u2022 }.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

These algorithms come in two flavors. First, random walks through Markov chains have been used to sample spanning trees from both undirected (Broder, 1989;Aldous, 1990) and directed graphs (Wilson, 1996). The algorithm of Wilson (1996) is linear in the mean hitting time of the graph and is currently the fastest sampling algorithm for directed spanning trees. It has been used in dependency parsing inference by Zhang et al. (2014a,b). Second, several algorithms have leveraged the matrix-tree theorem (MTT; Kirchhoff, 1847;Tutte, 1984). The MTT has been frequently used to perform inference on non-projective graphbased dependency parsers (Koo et al., 2007;Mc-Donald and Satta, 2007;Smith and Smith, 2007;Zmigrod et al., 2021). This theorem was first used for sampling by Gu\u00e9noche (1983) who gave an O(N 5 ) algorithm which was then improved by Kulkarni (1990) and Colbourn et al. (1996). Colbourn et al. (1996) give an O(N 3 ) algorithm to sample spanning trees from an unweighted directed graph. We generalize their algorithm to the weighted case."}}

So far, gamification in science focused on designing engaging experiences in citizen science, motivating the general public to contribute to scientific knowledge through micro tasks [10,22], and supporting the learning process of students [27].

Both aim to stimulate research documentation and sharing. A series of research activities informed the designs: we reviewed field studies, conducted interviews and observed a workshop, to learn about physicists' needs and perceptions towards the service.

In this paper, we explore possible uses of gamification to support reproducible practices. Past efforts attempted to stimulate good scientific practices through open science badges. They have been shown to significantly impact research data sharing practices of publications in the Psychological Science journal [28]. Yet, little empirical knowledge exists on the moderating effects of individual gamification mechanisms in professional scientific settings. In fact, it has recently been argued that mapping the impact of game design elements on specific domains is indeed much needed in gamification research today [31].", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_abstract": "The need for data preservation and reproducible research is widely recognized in the scientific community. Yet, researchers often struggle to find the motivation to contribute to data repositories and to use tools that foster reproducibility. In this paper, we explore possible uses of gamification to support reproducible practices in High Energy Physics. To understand how gamification can be effective in research tools, we participated in a workshop and performed interviews with data analysts. We then designed two interactive prototypes of a research preservation service that use contrasting gamification strategies. The evaluation of the prototypes showed that gamification needs to address core scientific challenges, in particular the fair reflection of quality and individual contribution. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes which describe perceptions and requirements of gamification in research: Contribution, Metrics, Applications and Scientific practice. Based on these, we discuss design implications for gamification in science.", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_4": "In Rethinking Gamification [24], Deterding stresses that \"motivational design should revolve around designing whole systems for motivational affordances, not adding elements with presumed-determined motivational effects. \" In The Maturing of Gamification Research, recently published by Nacke and Deterding [31], the authors highlight that gamification's early research focused on few contexts, like education. As not all contexts and desired behaviors are equally suited for gamification, \"extending the use of gamification beyond these contexts, and systematically studying the moderating effects of different individual and situational contexts is thus very much in need today\". The authors argue that \"we are just at the beginning of understanding what gamification design elements and methods best map onto what application domains\". Recent work from Orji, Tondello and Nacke [34] represents a good example, mapping impact of persuasive strategies on gamification user types for persuasive gameful health systems. Basing their study on storyboards, they illustrate how gamification research profits from novel methods.

Documenting and sharing research data and resources are key requirements of reproducible research [3,43]. But, the efforts required to prepare, document and share experimental data [9] are often not matched by the perceived gain. In fact, studies claim that the scientific culture does not support or even impairs compliance with reproducible practices [4,17]. Considering missing incentive structures, common proposals target the implementation of policies; most prominently concerning funding rules [36] and requirements for conference and journal submissions [5,39].", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_8": "Structure. First, participants were quickly introduced to CAP and were shown the analysis submission form of their corresponding collaboration, in order to get familiar with the context. Afterwards, half of the participants started exploring the RID version, the other half the SGED one. They started with the dashboard and explored the various views on their own. We prepared a few questions for every principal view that aimed to stimulate feedback. Following the design exploration, we asked the physicists to respond to a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire, structured as follows: \u2022 An abbreviated Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) scale was used, as it provides two valuable subscales. We considered assessing the perceived Value / Usefulness (5 items) to be of key importance for gamification in science, as well as Interest / Enjoyment (4 items). Enjoyment has also been used to characterize user preferences of game design elements by Tondello et al. [41]. The interest / enjoyment subscale assesses intrinsic motivation per se, while task meaningfulness appeals to the innate need for autonomy [38]. \u2022 We further asked to rate a statement that targets the suitability of the design: The system is NOT suitable for a research preservation service. Finally, The system would influence me to document my analyses, targets the persuasiveness of the design, also core to the study of Orji et al.

Following our initial expectation that gamification in a professional scientific context is most likely to profit from a serious, informative and rule-based design language, we created the Rational-Informative Design (RID) that provides information expected to appeal to HEP researchers. The RID was designed to make less use of most common game elements like points and leaderboards. Instead, it uses elements of \"Social networks\", \"Social discovery\", \"Signposting\" and \"Challenges\" (the LHC collaboration goal on the dashboard) as suggested by Tondello et al. [41]. This enables an exploration of gameful design elements in the HEP context. Yet, as scientists are already subjected to a high degree of competition, we also created a contrasting Simple Game Elements Design (SGED) version that focuses on point-based rewards and competitive elements. The basic UI design rules (color scheme, arrangements, etc.) are the same for both versions and are inspired by the actual service design. We built interactive wireframes with a high level of detail using the prototyping tool Balsamiq. As it is impractical to develop two functional, productive designs for the purpose of studying perceptions, we decided in favor of fully interactive prototypes. This approach is also motivated by recent, novel research methods, mapping persuasive strategies to gamification user types based on storyboards [34].", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_para_7": "Although our study did not explicitly explore autonomy experiences with gamified applications or serious games, its results still arguably speak to the frequent concern that gamification may create demotivating coercion rather than engaging play. Most critiques of this kind draw on SDT in some form [8,31,58,59,61], hypothesizing that the progress feedback and reward elements central to gamification (points, badges, leaderboards) produce the well-documented effect of extrinsic rewards undermining existing intrinsic motivation by thwarting autonomy [64]. In a sense, although gamification criticism is concerned with differences in autonomy between entertainment and applied gaming, like game enjoyment research, it has chiefly focused system design not social context.

Several scholars in human-computer interaction (HCI) [8], informatics [31], and game studies [58,59,61,63] hypothesize that mainstream forms of gamification -behavior tracking, quantitative progress feedback, and reward systems -might thwart rather than support the openness, inconsequentiality, and voluntariness characteristic for play. And evidence suggests that forced serious game play results in negative affect and reduced performance [19], and that worker consent moderates whether imposed workplace gamification results in positive or negative affect [29].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_9": "Given that studies and analyses in science are often conducted over a long period of time, it is crucial to provide accessible goals. This applies particularly to research-related achievements. Awards that promote best practices should not only target the ultimate goal requiring months and years of effort, but intermediate steps. Whenever possible, binary reward mechanisms should be replaced by more multifaceted structures. Doing so is likely to prevent discouragement through facing a goal that is very hard to reach, but might instead provide a sense of progress, one of the design pattern for gamification of work by Swacha and Muszy\u0144ska [40], making an \"employee aware that every action he/she performs is a step in progress. \" Yet, doing so might become more challenging in a scientific context, characterized by novelty and creativity.

SDT argues that human beings actively seek out and engage in activities that satisfy basic psychological needs of competence, relatedness, and autonomy: perceiving oneself as the causal origin of one's actions. Basic need satisfaction explains why activities like play are intrinsically motivating, while autonomy provides a well-established construct for \"voluntariness\". SDT-informed research has identified contextual features that affect autonomy and demonstrated that need satisfaction can explain game play motivation. Finally, most critiques of gamification draw on SDT in some form to theorize its potential adverse effects [8,31,58,59,61] -yet have remained at the stage of hypothesizing.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_para_8": "Obligatory contexts furthermore provide little or no license to configure and (dis)engage with the situation to fit one's interests and needs. Beyond directly thwarting autonomy, this also makes it less likely that people will engage in an activity that supplies intrinsic enjoyment. Thus, where engagement with a serious game or gamified application is mandated, and/or the game or application reinforce existing restrictions of conduct, this will likely reduce people's autonomy. Several scholars and practitioners have suggested that 'good' gamification should be voluntary to participate in; only involve activities that are voluntary to begin with, or in the case of workplace gamification, not involve core job tasks necessarily linked to remuneration and promotion; and rather than reinforce existing regulations, it should restructure activity such that participants have a greater ability to align what they do when, how, and with whom with their own interests and needs, analogous to e.g. Montessori pedagogy or results-only work environments [31,58,61,[65][66][67][68].

When it comes to social contexts of gameplay, research has focused on the effect of social presence and social interaction -the general argument being that more social presence and interaction equals a better gaming experience [5,14,17,24,27]. Some studies have explicitly linked the effect of social presence on game enjoyment to SDT, namely the satisfaction of relatedness needs [24].", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_metadata": "Authors: Minha Lee, Renee Noortman, Cristina Zaga, A.

In their work, Hamari et al. [26] conducted a literature review of empirical studies on gamification. They report on 10 investigated motivational affordance categories, including levels, stories, clear goals, feedback, rewards, progress and challenges, noting that \"points, leaderboards, and badges were clearly the most commonly found variants. \" As becomes increasingly evident, gamification that adds leaderboards, points and badges only to drive business goals, is likely to prevent long-lasting engagement and even risks alienating users [32]. Instead, gamification profits from a holistic design process that appeals to the intrinsic motivation of the players [11,19], requiring systematic, user-centered designs [29,42]. This motivated our researcher-centered gamification design process. Intrinsic motivation results from activities that are perceived as satisfactorily or pleasurably in themselves. Self-determination theory (SDT), as described by Ryan and Deci [37], distinguishes intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is based on external goals that represent outcomes separable from the activity itself (e.g. rewards, money or social approval) and intrinsic motivation comes from psychological needs: Competence, Autonomy and Relatedness.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_13": "Much of the discussion about uncertainty in science and risk communication treats uncertainty as problematic, or as a challenge to be overcome [119]. Hence there is intense focus on identifying and reducing sources of uncertainty in risk models and developing efective means of communicating the remainder. While such eforts are no doubt essential, there are several strands of work in HCI that explore the benefts of engaging with uncertainty. Research in the area of ambiguous design, for example, has argued that purposeful inclusion of ambiguity can support deeper appropriation of complex technologies by users [42]. Game design rests on careful use of uncertainty to create tension, challenge, and engagement from participants [25]. Prior crisis informatics research in food risk visualization has explored the role of serious games and deliberative risk communication strategies to support deeper understanding of complex information about disaster [116]. Such approaches also show promise in the context of tropical storm risk communication [12].", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_metadata": "Authors: J. N.

We show that the type of smartphone-based activity and the interactional context afect the way in which a particular instance of smartphone use is designed and oriented to by other participants. Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75]. By analyzing naturally occurring interactions, this study seeks to identify issues with existing defnitions of phubbing and ofers a new conceptualization for future research.

Moreover, the aspiration is that the agency in the technology creation process, now reserved to HCI researchers, through DIY approaches, can be handed over to the people who want and need it [68]. In these cases, emphasis is placed on the potential of making as a means of empowering those who are perceived as disempowered [11], understanding empowerment as the \"processes and outcomes relating to issues of control and access to resources, critical awareness of the socio-political environment, and participation with others\" [89].", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_abstract": "Maker culture encourages do-it-yourself practices to create, repair, and repurpose technology.

From earlier research on the use of and barriers to DIY technologies, we already learned about the challenges with respect to efort expectancy and the lack of facilitating conditions [77], the lack of alignment with clinical practice [37], the time-consuming process of confguration and adding content due to openness of DIY toolkits [52], and the lack of representation of end-users in the design [11], resulting in design for others [56]. Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_metadata": "Authors: Christopher Chu, Scot Fang, Kevin Knight | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_metadata": "Authors: Hyunchul Lim, Jungmin Chung, Changhoon Oh, Sohyun Park, Joonhwan Lee, B.

Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]). However, this individualistic perspective overlooks how students, teachers and therapists are afected by the organisations within which they operate, and which in turn are impacted on a societal level, thereby risking to undermine ongoing processes of empowerment.", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

In sum, the diverse studies on maker technologies for assistive technology provide a mixed and nuanced view of their potential for disabled people, and when deployed in a school environment. While certain studies highlight benefts in terms of cost [41], accessibility [39], ft [39,77], and reducing stigma [16,77], other studies suggest that a making practice does not to align with a clinical practice [37], and still presents barriers for adoption, such as a lack of ease-of-use or physical infrastructure [77]. In a school environment, researchers additionally foreground the time-consuming process and the need for researchers to consider how to ensure uptake after researchers leave the feld [71]. Finally, several researchers stress the lack of diversity in DIY practices, leading to DFO instead [37]. Similar echos can be found when scrutinizing DIY practices in realms beyond AT; for example several authors have published critical refections on the promises of DIY maker technology used in a generic school environment [4, 75, e.g.]. Ames et al., also similar to Hofman and Meisner [37,56], question who is in control, who gets excluded, and what making could contribute to society [3]. Regarding inclusion, Marshall and Rode deconstruct the sociotechnical identity formation within maker culture through an ethnographic study of STEAM skill building activities [55]. The study found complex tensions regarding gender and (maker) technology excluding those who do not identify as male. Therefore, the question remains how maker technologies can be help to design assistive technologies that truly empower, helping \"people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over issues of concern to them\" [43] in a school environment. Regarding the use of DIY assistive technology in schools for disabled children, there is still not enough research that support the promises of empowerment in this specifc environment.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59]. This paradox was at the heart of this paper, exploring the potential of DIY approaches in a school for disabled children.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_metadata": "Authors: Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Zhihao Fan, Zengfeng Huang, Weijian Sun, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_metadata": "Authors: Valtteri Wikstr\u00f6m, M.

We have focused on richness of content, dissecting and unveiling how ongoing processes, including the design of technology can stymie processes of empowerment, in this manner aspiring to present an honest account of the actual environment, as an 'ultimate particular' [60,79] of activities in the school [84].

However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015). Recently, neural architectures have been shown effective in such a task, whereby minimal feature engineering is required (Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Peters et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Domain adaptation, as a special case for transfer learning, aims to exploit the abundant data of wellstudied source domains to improve the performance in target domains of interest (Pan and Yang, 2010;Weiss et al., 2016). There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain. The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process. Figure 1 illustrates the two approaches based on the BLSTM-CRF (bidirectional LSTM augmented with a CRF layer) architecture for NER. While such approaches make intuitive senses, they also come with some limitations.", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_0": "Being able to associate entity mentions in a given text with the correct entity they refer to is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_abstract": "Formality text style transfer plays an important role in various NLP applications, such as non-native speaker assistants and child education.

The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work. Some works (Gong et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020;Gu et al., 2021) propose progressive learning to accelerate the pre-training, which are motivated by the fact that different layers have some similar knowledge (e.g., attention patterns). They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) proposes a task of replaced token detection to predict whether each token in the input was replaced or not, which improves the pre-training efficiency. Our method is orthogonal to this kind of work and the combination of ELECTRA and bert2BERT could achieve better efficiency.

Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving method proposed in computer vision on the Transformer-based language model, and further improve it by proposing a novel method, advanced knowledge for large model\u2019s initialization. In addition, a two-stage learning method is proposed to further accelerate the pre-training.

These algorithms come in two flavors. First, random walks through Markov chains have been used to sample spanning trees from both undirected (Broder, 1989;Aldous, 1990) and directed graphs (Wilson, 1996). The algorithm of Wilson (1996) is linear in the mean hitting time of the graph and is currently the fastest sampling algorithm for directed spanning trees. It has been used in dependency parsing inference by Zhang et al. (2014a,b). Second, several algorithms have leveraged the matrix-tree theorem (MTT; Kirchhoff, 1847;Tutte, 1984). The MTT has been frequently used to perform inference on non-projective graphbased dependency parsers (Koo et al., 2007;Mc-Donald and Satta, 2007;Smith and Smith, 2007;Zmigrod et al., 2021). This theorem was first used for sampling by Gu\u00e9noche (1983) who gave an O(N 5 ) algorithm which was then improved by Kulkarni (1990) and Colbourn et al. (1996). Colbourn et al. (1996) give an O(N 3 ) algorithm to sample spanning trees from an unweighted directed graph. We generalize their algorithm to the weighted case.", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_metadata": "Authors: Min-Hsuan Yeh, Lun-Wei Ku | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_metadata": "Authors: Koren Lazar, Benny Saret, Asaf Yehudai, W.

We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

When each concept fragment is processed, edges are added between the current concept fragment and its predecessors. However, how to treat its predecessors is a difficult problem. In our experiments, we found that if we consider every preceding concept fragment to the left of the current fragment in a right-to-left order in the search process, the decoder suffers from low efficiency and poor performance. Unlike the beam-search for dependency parsing, which can greatly reduce the search space by exploiting the projectivity property of the dependency tree (Covington, 2001;Zhang and Clark, 2008a), this naive search process in this context inevitably leads to huge search space, and furthermore is difficult to guarantee the connectivity of output graph. Instead, we propose a componentwise beam search scheme, which can not only alleviate much noisy partial candidate, but also ensure that the final output graph is connected.", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_metadata": "Authors: Christopher Chu, Scot Fang, Kevin Knight | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

However, the agent's voice always emanates from the device, even when that information is contextually and spatially relevant elsewhere. Digital Ventriloquism allows smart speakers to render sound onto everyday objects, such that it appears they are speaking and are interactive. This can be achieved without any modification of objects or the environment. For this, we used a highly directional pan-tilt ultrasonic array. By modulating a 40 kHz ultrasonic signal, we can emit sound that is inaudible \"in flight\" and demodulates to audible frequencies when impacting a surface through acoustic parametric interaction. This makes it appear as though the sound originates from an object and not the speaker. We ran a study in which we projected speech onto five objects in three environments, and found that participants were able to correctly identify the source object 92% of the time and correctly repeat the spoken message 100% of the time, demonstrating our digital ventriloquy is both directional and intelligible.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_title": "On Looking at the Vagina through Labella", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_para_1": "While AAC devices are significantly lacking in the ability to generate expressive speech, a large amount of speech synthesis research has aimed at creating more expressive speech engines [24]. Synthesizing human-quality expressivity in synthetic speech is still an open problem, but significant advances have been made. Speech engines such as Pitrelli et. al.'s [20] have the ability to render speech that listeners can identify as exhibiting several different tones (e.g., \"conveying bad news\" or \"asking yes-no questions\"). Several commercial engines such as the IBM Watson [28], CereVoice [4], and Nuance Loquendo [18] allow for the rendering of emotional synthesized speech. Each of these systems is similar in allowing developers to select between a small set of emotional categories when rendering speech (e.g., CereVoice supports a default voice in addition to \"happy,\" \"sad,\" \"calm,\" and \"cross\"). Recent developments on the MaryTTS engine (an open-source TTS research platform) [14] have extended beyond simply accepting the specification of emotional categories, allowing for emotional tones to be specified with continuous values for emotional dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance [5]. In addition to allowing for the high-level specification of a tone of voice, each of these TTS engines also supports low-level speech modifications through the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2]. SSML is an XML-based language for specifying prosodic information such as the rate of speech, volume, baseline pitch, emphasized words, and pauses.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_9": "Luke is always smiling and does not easily give up.

Similarly, the giggly and funny experience of interacting with Labella provides both psychological and physical ease to look at and understand the self, sometimes for the first time. In addition, the technology provides a (physical and digital) space in which looking at oneself is acceptable (the app suggests so) and legitimate (research). Moreover, women's accounts of the body being \"weird\" or \"funny\" seek to strengthen the notion that humorous interactions within the body can be advantageous to encourage conversations and breaking taboos. In this regard, interactions that incorporate humour in design have the possibility to support awkward learning, which may be charged with not only physical or social but also emotional stigma and taboo. More so, we find evidence that this awkward, funny interaction which involves physicality and the social emotive taboo results in an affective experience [36], that may contribute to making an impression and a memorable learning experience.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_abstract": "We demonstrate a program that learns to pronounce Chinese text in Mandarin, without a pronunciation dictionary.

Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

Current speech generating devices (SGD) used for AAC offer little in the way of allowing users to control the expressive nature of the speech rendered from the user's input [11]. This is surprising given that advances in speech synthesis technologies over the past decade have resulted in the development of text-to-speech (TTS) engines capable of rendering speech that exhibits a range of emotions (e.g., CereProc [4], Nuance Loquendo [18], and IBM Watson [30] are commercial speech engines capable of emotional speech synthesis). Additionally, most TTS engines accept Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2] as input, allowing for a degree of control over prosodic features such as the rate of speech, the pitch of the voice, and cadence/pacing of words. The fact that these advances have yet to be incorporated into SGDs in a meaningful way is a major issue for AAC. Recent work such as that of Higginbotham [9], Kane et. al. [11], and Pullin et al. [22] has described the importance of this issue and the need to develop better AAC systems capable of more expressive speech, but to date, there are no research or commercially available AAC devices that provide advanced expressive speech capabilities, with a majority only allowing for basic modification of speech parameters (overall rate and volume) that cannot be varied on-the-fly (as utterances are constructed and played), while not leveraging the capabilities available in modern TTS engines.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_9": "To understand the differences between our three experimental conditions (i.e., gestures produced by people with visual impairments, gestures produced by people without visual impairments, and synthesized gestures for people with visual impairments), we ran a one-way ANOVA test (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected to control for deviations in sphericity), followed by pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) as post-hoc tests of significance, if applicable.

Human bodies accumulate toxic waste and after we die, our \"return\" to nature can thus be harmful. To combat this, a mushroom suit is said to decompose one's body safely by removing or neutralizing toxicity. 9 Hence, the conversation combines the topics of self-identity and climate change. For feasibility, the character \"Flo\" in the conversation below represents a set of 3D printed fowers ( Figure 5), which are added to smart speakers. They are analogous to the Alias technology, which is a 3D printable \"parasite\" (depicted in Figure 6) that can be added on top of a smart speaker to create a \"hacked\" CUI, This can stop smart speakers from listening in on conversations when they are not in use. In addition, Alias can help people to rename their smart speakers without losing their functionality, allowing users to utter custom \"wake words\" or sounds instead of default names, such as \"Hey, Alexa\". For our exploration, we imagine that 3D-printable and customizable fowers would be added to smart speakers; these fowers can talk to present-day people about how and why they grow from human bodies. As discussed above, design fction and speculative design are approaches that could help to shape how interactions with CUIs can be designed. A fctional conversation for this exploration is below (as written by the frst author): We explored a diferent use case for CUIs, as a starting point to challenge our habits. As Refowering Self suggests, we can trigger people's critical refection towards behavioral change by directly involving one's present and future selves. Flo is foremost sharing \"our\" side of the story in its version of the future, i.e., 'sharing advice' [70], rather than directly preaching to a person about what to do. Its repeated use of \"us\", \"our\", \"we\", i.e., as frstperson plural pronouns, takes on a tone of solidarity between our present and future selves, as a message on how \"we are in the together\". The emphasis, again, is in juxtaposing diferent temporal dimensions as an experience that CUIs can foster, which is what prior research has not looked into. Such ludic experiences focus less on sustainable behavior as a \"to-do list\", cf. [72], but as refective conversations in our everyday lives with CUIs.

Besides a default upward oriented orientation, we test triangles rotated using data-driven factors, with circles as a default option without inherent orientation.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

We experiment with two language pairs: English-to-Chinese (en-zh) and English-to-German (en-de). We mine translations from monolingual CommonCrawl data processed as described above for self-supervised MLM pretraining. After processing, there are 1.17B, 0.6B, 7.73B sentences for Chinese (zh), German (de), and English (en), respectively. LaBSE embeddings are used to pair each non-English sentence with its nearest English neighbor, dropping pairs with a similarity score < 0.6. 20 For en-de and en-zh, we train a model with Transformer-Big (Vaswani et al., 2017) in the following way: First we train the model on the mined data as is for 120k steps with batch size 10k. Then we select the best 20% using Wang  Results in table 7 show the effectiveness of the mined training data. By referencing previous results (Edunov et al., 2018), we see that the model using the en-de mined data yields performance that is only 2.8 BLEU away from performance of the best system that made use of the official WMT17 en-de parallel data. Compare to prior en-zh results (Sennrich et al., 2017), we see that our model using mined en-zh training data is as good as a WMT17 NMT model that is trained on the official WMT en-zh parallel data. The table also gives BLEU performance on the TED test set (Qi et al., 2018), with performance of models trained on our mined training data being comparable with models trained using CCMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2019). 21", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

Zhang et al. [17] developed an automatic refactoring tool for Android applications which enables the applications to perform on-demand computation offloading at runtime to improve the performance and save energy. Lin et al. [9] developed an automatic refactoring tool which transfers incorrect An-droid async constructs into correct ones. The tool can extract long-running operations and encapsulate them in Async-Task for better performance. The application refactoring tool ASYNCDROID [8] helps Android developers to correct misused asynchronous programming constructs (AsyncTask) to IntentService, which uses a distributed communication instead of shared memory communication to prevent memory leak. Hao et al. [5] proposed a binary instrumentation framework for Android applications which can be used to specify instrumentation location compactly and precisely at different granularities. Lenin Ravindranath et al. [12] implemented an automatic fault detecting system for mobile applications by instrumenting the application binary to emulate various user, network and sensor behaviors to detect failures.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

The current study supports these previous fndings and design solutions by showing some of the ways in which co-present others return smartphone users back into interactions, for example, by commenting on the on-screen activity or by enquiring the smartphone user about the type of activity.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

There have been several proposals to alleviate this issue with, for instance, self-supervised learning techniques, but they still require human-annotated corpora. In this work, we explore the unsupervised learning paradigm which can potentially work with unlabeled text corpora that are cheaper and easier to obtain. Our model builds upon the recent work on Noisy Student Training, a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the idea of self-training. Experimental results on the commonly used English Switchboard test set show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art supervised systems using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. BERT and ELECTRA).", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_2": "Most work on disfluency detection focus on supervised learning methods, which mainly fall into three main categories: sequence tagging, noisy-channel, and parsing-based approaches. Sequence tagging approaches label words as fluent or disfluent using a variety of different techniques, including conditional random fields (CRF) (Georgila, 2009;Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014), Max-Margin Markov Networks (M 3 N) (Qian and Liu, 2013), Semi-Markov CRF (Ferguson et al., 2015), and recurrent neural networks (Hough and Schlangen, 2015;Zayats et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016). The main benefit of sequential models is the ability to capture longterm relationships between reparandum and repairs. Noisy channel models (Charniak and Johnson, 2001;Johnson and Charniak, 2004;Zwarts et al., 2010;Lou and Johnson, 2017) use the similarity between reparandum and repair as an indicator of disfluency. Parsing-based approaches (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013;Honnibal and Johnson, 2014;Wu et al., 2015;Yoshikawa et al., 2016;Jamshid Lou et al., 2019) jointly perform parsing and disfluency detection. The joint models can capture long-range dependency of disfluencies as well as chunk-level information. However, training a parsing-based model requires large annotated tree-banks that contain both disfluencies and syntactic structures.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_abstract": "We demonstrate a program that learns to pronounce Chinese text in Mandarin, without a pronunciation dictionary. From non-parallel streams of Chinese characters and Chinese pinyin syllables, it establishes a many-to-many mapping between characters and pronunciations.

Its token-level character-to-syllable accuracy is 89%, which significantly exceeds the 22% accuracy of prior work.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_0": "Dataset.

Following Honnibal and Johnson (2014), we lower-case the text and remove all punctuations and partial words. 2 We also discard the 'um' and 'uh' tokens and merge 'you know' and 'i mean' into single tokens.", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_abstract": "The paper presents a first attempt towards unsupervised neural text simplification that relies only on unlabeled text corpora.

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_para_5": "Existing work on generation of novel commonsense knowledge has also used ConceptNet and ATOMIC as underlying KBs.

Our work differs from this approach as their models evaluate full tuples rather than learning to generate the phrases to make new nodes in the knowledge graph. Saito et al. (2018) builds upon this work by proposing a joint model for completion and generation of commonsense tuples. Their work, however, focuses on using tuple generation to augment their KB completion model, rather than to increase coverage in commonsense KB construction. Finally, Sap et al.

These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex. Human evaluation also proves that our model is able to generate relevant and informative questions.", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

We match the score of Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer Base (T5 BASE ) (Raffel et al., 2020), a state-of-theart model that uses BERT BASE hyperparameters, while using only half the parameters, shorter training (3/8 tokens overall), and a fraction (1/37) of the data compared to T5. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the proposed objective through a qualitative analysis of the neighbor sentences of sentences that have similar sentential representations. We show that the results support our aim of enriching the transformer model with sentencelevel language understanding.", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_metadata": "Authors: Shoaib Jameel, S.

Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. We explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence, where the evidence for each candidate is based on a small set of strong relations, rather than relations to all other entities in the document. The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB.

We address a new application of attention, and introduce a significantly different attention mechanism, which allows each variable to focus on multiple objects. We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_metadata": "Authors: Tingting Liu, Xiaotong Li, Chen Bao, M.

While all these directions are definitely interesting, they are nevertheless challenging, but worth exploring in order to advance our theoretical and practical knowledge of simulating input data across different user populations toward better interface designs for users will all abilities. Looking forward, we believe that our work already forms a good demonstration of how simulation can be used to refine the gesture design process within HCI and accessibility research and we are eager to see how the community will pick up these ideas and use them for other application areas. CONCLUSION We presented a principled method to generate gesture samples for people with visual impairments using gestures collected from people without visual impairments. Our method is based on the foundations of the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements and its associated Sigma-Lognormal model. The software implementing our method is publicly available at https://g3.prhlt.upv.es, while the gestures dataset can be downloaded from http://www.eed.usv.ro/~vatavu.", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_metadata": "Authors: Alexander J.

GPSR is strongly focused on rapid UI prototyping, is computationally efficient, and adds minimal coding overhead. However, GPSR does not synthesize timestamps, which precludes a fine-grained analysis of handwriting behavior [34]. In contrast, G3 relies on the Kinematic Theory and, consequently, takes a more generic approach to gesture synthesis. G3 creates a model of a user-provided gesture example to which it adds local and global perturbations. Although resulting gestures are human-like [28], G3 employs a set of generic \u03a3\u039bM parameters acquired from people without disabilities [18] and, consequently, it is unlikely that these variability ranges would also account for the actual variability attributed to people with various gesture articulation abilities.", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_metadata": "Authors: Martez E Mott, John Tang, Edward Cutrell | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_metadata": "Authors: Josh Andr\u00e9s, M.

Finegrained analyses of users' gesture articulations are also possible to understand how users vary their gestures relative to each other and relative to recognizers' canonical template forms [65,66]. Also, gesture recognition algorithms have been using many gesture features, such as path length, articulation time, or average speed [8,52], that can be repurposed as gesture performance measures to evaluate users' gesture articulations [51,68]. However, most of these measures, although useful for gesture classification, lack descriptive power for gesture analysis because they focus on the global characteristics of a gesture as a whole. In contrast, the Gesture RElative Accuracy Toolkit (GREAT) [65], which we employ in this work, enables access to fine-grained measurements on the gesture path that reveal and help understand the subtleties of users' gesture articulations. More specifically, the GREAT measures describe the many ways in which gestures unfold in time, space, stroke structure, and appearance, characterizing gesture articulations in terms of their closeness to a reference form, analogous to MacKenzie et al.'s accuracy measures for pointing tasks [31].", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_9": "To understand the differences between our three experimental conditions (i.e., gestures produced by people with visual impairments, gestures produced by people without visual impairments, and synthesized gestures for people with visual impairments), we ran a one-way ANOVA test (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected to control for deviations in sphericity), followed by pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) as post-hoc tests of significance, if applicable. We observed statistically significant differences for most of the GREAT measures, marked with an asterisk in Figure 4 F (2,177) >4, p<.001, \u03b7 2 p <0.2 .

[23] showed that blind people prefer gestures that use an edge or a corner of the device and Buzzi et al. [11,12] reported preferences for round-shaped gestures, one-finger input, one-stroke gestures, and short trajectories. Detailed examination of gesture articulation paths [23] showed that blind people produce touch gestures that are different in size, speed, number of strokes, and gesture shape than the gestures produced by sighted people.

However, we formalized our method in a way that is independent of the characteristics of the target population so that it would be easy to apply for synthesizing gesture sets for other user populations as well. For example, touch input remains largely inaccessible to people with motor impairments who need to adopt workaround strategies to be able to access content on touchscreen devices [4,37] and who need specific touch interaction techniques [40]. We also know from the literature of touch interaction for children that small children between 3 and 6 years old experience difficulties with touch and multitouch input [67] and that the touch gestures of children between 7 and 10 years old are recognized with lower accuracy rates than the same gestures produced by adults [3]. Because our method is able to transfer the articulation characteristics of gestures produced by a few users to a particular user population, we believe that addressing other user groups, such as those mentioned above, is viable and we leave these interesting exploration opportunities for future work.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_metadata": "Authors: Wenjian Huang, T.

For example, Gesture Script [30] allows developers to describe the structure of a stroke gesture and, by using this information, the tool can synthesize new gesture samples by varying the relative scale and rotation of the gesture's components. Unfortunately, Gesture Script only works with unistroke gestures articulated in predefined ways. MAGIC Summoning [24] and Gesture Follower [13] are other tools that enable designers with means to generate synthetic gesture samples in 3D. MAGIC Summoning adds local perturbations to a gesture's resampled points, whereas Gesture Follower introduces variations into a gesture shape by using Viviani's 2/3 power law [69]. Both approaches are promising, although synthetic gestures might perform poorly for gesture recognition because of insufficient variation required for high-quality training [49]. However, this prior work has put forward the importance of increasing gesture recognition accuracy with large training datasets.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_3": "The amount and quality of training data are key factors for competitive gesture recognition.

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_11": "The process of designing gesture sets is complex, as it involves many motor and cognitive aspects that the designer must consider, such as good discriminability with respect to other gestures in the set [1], ease of execution [43,68], ease of learning and memorability [42], good fit to application functions [39,71], etc. This process usually involves a lot of trial and error, where gestures go in and out of the gesture set while the designer optimizes the structure of the set with respect to the above criteria.

The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \"idle\" fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system.

The mirror game, where two people create joint motion in an improvised pattern, has been used to study different aspects of face-to-face collaboration and synchronization. To explore whether a similar game could be used to study computer-mediated interaction and as an ice-breaker activity to increase affiliation in remote collaboration, we developed a multiplayer online mouse coordination game inspired by the mirror game. The source code to the game is released as free open source software.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_metadata": "Authors: Manika Saha, Delvin Varghese, Tom Bartindale, S.

The tendency of humans to mirror each others behavior is an important social signal, used for showing affiliation and to guide the timing and tempo of social interaction. Intentionally increasing this kind of behavior has shown promise previously in improving social closeness and collaborative performance [5,10], and has been used in practice in the form of improvisational theatre and dance activities in workshops and therapy [1]. The game we have presented in this abstract is intended as a similar ice breaker activity for online communications. We intend to carry out research about the possible benefits playing SynchroMouse could have preceding cooperation, as well as whether play strategies and performance in the game can be used to predict the outcomes of such cooperative activities and the experience of team members. Additionally, since the task is released to the community as open source, we encourage others to use it and adapt it to their needs.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_metadata": "Authors: Jiahuan Zheng, Xin Peng, Jiacheng Yang, Huaqian Cai, Gang Huang, Ying Zhang, Wenyun Zhao | Venue: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work | Year: 2017 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

The basic idea is to map dependency arcs from a source treebank to its target translation according to word alignments. This method, however, can suffer from imperfect alignment between source and target words. To address this problem, we investigate syntactic transfer by code mixing, translating only confident words in a source treebank. Cross-lingual word embeddings are leveraged for transferring syntactic knowledge to the target from the resulting code-mixed treebank. Experiments on University Dependency Treebanks show that code-mixed treebanks are more effective than translated treebanks, giving highly competitive performances among cross-lingual parsing methods.", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_para_2": "Source Treebank Adaption.

Take dependency grammar for instance. Given a source treebank, machine translation is used to find target translations of its sentences. Then word alignment is used to find mappings between source and target words, so that source syntactic dependencies can be projected to the target translations. Following, a postprocessing step is applied by removing unaligned target words, in order to ensure that the resulting target syntax forms a valid dependency tree, The method has shown promising performance for unsupervised cross-lingual dependency parsing among transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011;T\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et al., 2012;Rasooli and Collins, 2015;Guo et al., 2016b). * Corresponding author.  The treebank translation method, however, suffers from various sources of noise. For example, machine translation errors directly affect the resulting treebank, by introducing ungrammatical word sequences. In addition, the alignments between source and target words may not be isomorphic due to inherent differences between languages or paraphrasing during translation. For example, in the case of Figure 1, the English words \"are\" and \"being\", and the Swedish word \"med\", do not have corresponding word-level translation. In addition, it can be perfect to express \"as soon as they can\" using \"very quickly\" in a translation, which looses word alignment information because of the longer span. Finally, errors in automatic word alignments can also bring noise. Such alignment errors can directly affect grammaticality of the resulting target treebank due to deletion of unaligned words during post-processing, or cause lost or mistaken dependency arcs.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_para_4": "Our work follows another mainstream method of this line of work, namely treebank translation (Tiedemann et al., 2014;Tiedemann, 2015;Tiedemann and Agi\u0107, 2016), which aims to adapt an annotated source treebank into the target language by machine translation.

The present work takes many of the insights developed in these models (e.g. the recurrent representation of spans (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016), and the use of a dynamic oracle and exploration policy during training (Goldberg and Nivre, 2013)) and extends these insights to span-oriented models, which support a wider range of decoding procedures. Our approach differs from other recent chart-based neural models (e.g. Durrett and Klein (2015)) in the use of a recurrent input representation, structured loss function, and comparatively simple parameterization of the scoring function. In addition to the globally optimal decoding procedures for which these models were designed, and in contrast to the left-to-right decoder typically employed by transition-based models, our model admits an additional greedy top-to-bottom inference procedure.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_metadata": "Authors: Christopher Chu, Scot Fang, Kevin Knight | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_5": "To evaluate our interpretation technique on real world data, we applied our method on four trained models over two tasks: recognizing textual entailment using the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference corpus (Williams et al., 2018) and named entity recognition using the CoNLL 2003 data (Sang and Meulder, 2003) for English NER.

The essence of outdoor play is \"heads up\" social interaction and physical activity [11,16,31,43], which are not natural characteristics of coding activities. Moreover, adding screens to outdoor play (a coding platform running on a tablet device) is thought to interfere with natural play patterns [34] and compromise the benefits of natural play [44]. Nonetheless, the children successfully bridged this gap, using the \"heads down\" coding activity to create code that generates a \"heads up\" outdoor game experience. In addition, children played their games with their friends with no further adjustments to the code, indicating that they were able to program playable outdoor games. This may be attributed to the clear distinction between the coding platform and the digital device, that framed the coding platform as a tool for defining the game and the device as a tool for playing the game. Future work should test this assumption and compare the digital coding platform to a more tangible coding platform.

Coding, a typically indoor, screen-based activity, can potentially enrich outdoor play, serving as a rule-making medium. We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device, enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas, coding them, and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study, 24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones, enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements, integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code, and were excited to see their code come to life. We conclude children can use coding to express their ideas by creating technologically-enhanced outdoor play experiences.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

This paper proposes a new multi-axis modeling to better capture the temporal structure of events. In addition, we identify that event end-points are a major source of confusion in annotation, so we also propose to annotate TempRels based on start-points only. A pilot expert annotation effort using the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in IAA from the conventional 60\u2019s to 80\u2019s (Cohen\u2019s Kappa). This better-defined annotation scheme further enables the use of crowdsourcing to alleviate the labor intensity for each annotator.

These datasets were annotated by experts, but most still suffered from low inter-annotator agreements (IAA). For instance, the IAAs of TB-Dense, RED and THYME-TimeML (Styler IV et al., 2014) were only below or near 60% (given that events are already annotated). Since a low IAA usually indicates that the task is difficult even for humans (see Examples 1-3), the community has been looking into ways to simplify the task, by reducing the label set, and by breaking up the overall, complex task into subtasks (e.g., getting agreement on which event pairs should have a relation, and then what that relation should be) (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016;O'Gorman et al., 2016). In contrast to other existing datasets, Bethard et al. (2007) achieved an agreement as high as 90%, but the scope of its annotation was narrowed down to a very special verb-clause structure.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_para_3": "(v) Whether the two verbs have a common synonym from their synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). (vi) Whether the input event mentions have a common derivational form derived from WordNet. (vii) The head words of the preposition phrases that cover each event, respectively. And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks. In the future, more data can be collected and used with advanced techniques such as ILP (Do et al., 2012), structured learning (Ning et al., 2017) or multi-sieve .  Table 6: Performance of the proposed baseline system on MATRES. Line \"Original\" is the same system retrained on the original TB-Dense and tested on the same subset of event pairs. Due to the limited number of equal examples, the system did not make any equal predictions on the testset.", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in

"This paper contributes by 1) defining temporal pointing in terms of the concept of temporal target and 2) deriving a novel mathematical model to predict error rates. The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31].

Several techniques automatically extract instructional video clips from screencasts of software use. The dominant approach leverages application usage [10,20,29,52], requiring that the video be recorded in an instrumented version of the software. Alternatively, computer vision can detect tool-selection events [32,41], even without prior knowledge about the specific software [5]. To be application-independent and embed online videos directly without waiting to download and process them, RePlay instead uses metadata and caption text to rank and segment videos.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_metadata": "Authors: C.

RePlay demonstrates this approach using video; different activities (e.g., programming) may benefit from other types of content (e.g., text resources). RePlay could naturally be extended to any textual content (or content with textual metadata). Text results could be displayed as short summaries with clickable keywords to expand more detail [13]. For detecting context, RePlay used MacOS's accessibility api; other oss (e.g. Windows [34]) also have similar apis. Beyond software, RePlay's approach could extend to any domain for which online videos are abundant (e.g., physical building tasks). To detect activity context, one could augment physical tools with sensors [31,46] or track body poses with wearable sensors or computer vision. A challenge for future work is to convert sensor or vision data into text searches, or to index videos using the sensor or vision data directly.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_metadata": "Authors: Rebecca Nicholson, Tom Bartindale, Ahmed Kharrufa, David S.

Indeed, recent research proves that usability criteria can be used in public IT procurement [43,49] although this has not yet become a standard procedure [29]. There are examples of such procedures in the field of healthcare [31,33] and usability tests are recommended as the primary evaluation method when purchasing a healthcare IT system [31,45]. However, studies give only an overview of rankings, but the used evaluation criteria [31,33], formulation of numerical results or justification behind rankings have not been described in detail. Also, user testing requires significant resources: testing five tasks for two different user groups on two competing systems has taken one month of effort [43].", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_metadata": "Authors: Martez E Mott, John Tang, Edward Cutrell | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_metadata": "Authors: Rebecca Nicholson, Tom Bartindale, Ahmed Kharrufa, David S.

While usability testing has been devised also for summative purposes, one could argue that inspection methods like HE have been designed for formative use because they provide mainly qualitative data on the usability problems [14]. The current practice on measuring usability indeed heavily relies on usability tests while inspection methods are not discussed [24]. Attempts to quantify HE have been presented [20] for evaluating the degree of usability of websites. In this model heuristics are divided into categories and problems are categorized accordingly resulting in a calculated usability score.", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_metadata": "Authors: M.

The increasing demands in public IT system procurement [29] of packaged/COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) software, introduce new summative-type uses for this wellestablished, widely applied method. Moreover, COTS procurement is an understudied systems context [36]. Current and emerging procurement surroundings pose challenging new requirements for fitting methods to the context and applying them properly.

Word-level F1, commonly used in the Machine Comprehension and ConvQA tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018Choi et al., 2018), evaluates the word overlap between the system's prediction and the ground truth answer span. Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1. Given n references (ground-truth answers) for each question, human F1 is calculated by averaging the maximum F1 from each n\u22121 subset with respect to the heldout reference (Choi et al., 2018). This metric is composed of HEQ-Q, computed at the question level, and HEQ-D, computed at the dialogue (conversation) level.

We suggest that they should consider how the integration system extends the user's abilities in the contexts of the experience. Using EEG to monitor neural activity can offer access to a user's preattentive processing state, resulting in possibilities for integration where the system responds to a situation \"before\" the user can with their body. This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

In a 2005 study by Yoos et al., 65% of parents whose children's current symptoms indicated severe asthma reported \"good control\" [8]. Tinschert et al. performed a review of all publicly available asthma management applications on the market and found tracking to be the most common feature functionality offered (79% offered some type of tracking related to asthma) [6]. The same paper suggests the use of virtual coaches, like chatbots to increase long-term engagement with asthma applications. While tools like the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ) have been found to be reliable surrogates in measuring asthma [3,5], there is some level of difference in how these tools evaluate the same symptoms [7].", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_metadata": "Authors: Nusrat Jahan Mim | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_metadata": "Authors: Shaomei Wu, Lindsay Reynolds, Xian Li, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2019 | Fields: Psychology, Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_metadata": "Authors: Manika Saha, Delvin Varghese, Tom Bartindale, S.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_metadata": "Authors: Motohiro Makiguchi, Daisuke Sakamoto, H.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_metadata": "Authors: Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2018 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_metadata": "Authors: Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, D.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_para_2": "VR is an ideal playground for the body ownership illusions (see, e.g., [7,51,55,61]). The current study leverages natural emergence of the sense of ownership and sense of agency in the virtual environments, i.e., feelings that the users own their virtual body or body parts and that they are the agents of actions of such virtual body. Using state-of-the-art VR (with a head-mounted display and accurate hand tracking), two VR scenes where participants experienced the illusory touch were created. In the active scene, participants actively touched a virtual object (ball) using their bare hands. On the contrary, the passive scene allowed participants to experience the illusory touch without actively moving their hands.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_metadata": "Authors: Filip \u0160kola, F.

To a great degree, current VR systems, being predominantly visual, depend on this effect. The second reason for emergence of the illusory touch is the way how the human brain constructs bodily representation. Information from the senses are integrated in the brain to form plausible (internally consistent) representation of own body [24]. It has been revealed that the multisensory integration process can be manipulated to create altered perception of the self. One of the earliest experiments demonstrating malleability of the bodily representation is known as the rubber hand illusion [6]. In the rubber hand illusion, simultaneous haptic stimulation of a participant's hand (hidden behind a screen) and a rubber hand placed ahead of the participant (in a natural resting position) leads to rising of feelings that the rubber hand is actually part of the participant's body, and the tactile sensations seem to be originating in the rubber hand.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_metadata": "Authors: Luis A.

VR scenes are mostly being perfected and examined in the visual domain, but engagement of other senses is also highly favorable for the design of immersive VR experiences. Classic approach to sense stimulation in VR consists of attaching a display to the relevant sensing organ [30]. Although this is effective for stimulation of vision and hearing (senses with relatively small sensing organs), it is much more difficult problem to stimulate the surface of the skin, the largest organ on the human body [8]. Recently, alternative approaches to haptic interfaces emerged, including electrical muscle stimulation [34,35].

In the case of the word embedding models, we create document vectors in the same way as we do for our model, by simply replacing the role of target word vectors with document word vectors. In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations. We tuned the dimensionality of the embedding from the pool {100, 150, 200} and the number of vMF mixture components from the pool {200, 500, 800}.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_6": "In this section, we describe the word embedding results, where we directly compare our model with the following baselines: GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), Skipgram (Mikolov et al., 2013b) (denoted as SG), Continuous Bag of Words (Mikolov et al., 2013b) (denoted as CBOW), and the recently proposed WeMAP model (Jameel et al., 2019).

These vectors are normally learned such that they are predictive of some word co-occurrence statistic, but they are otherwise unconstrained. However, the words from a given language can be organized in various natural groupings, such as syntactic word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs) and semantic themes (e.g. sports, politics, sentiment). Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors.

Note that documents are still modelled as multinomial distributions of topics in these models. In (He et al., 2017) the opposite approach is taken: documents and topics are represented as vectors, with the aim of modelling topic correlations in an efficient way, while each topic is represented as a multinomial distribution over words. In this paper, we take a different approach for learning document vectors, by not considering any documentspecific topic distribution.

This isotropy property is convenient for studying word embeddings from a theoretical point of view (Arora et al., 2016), but it sits at odds with fact that words can be organised in various natural groupings. For instance, we might perhaps expect that words from the same part-of-speech class should be clustered together in the word embedding. Similarly, we might expect that organising word vectors in clusters that represent semantic themes would also be beneficial. In fact, a number of approaches have already been proposed that use external knowledge for imposing such a cluster structure, capturing the intuition that words which belong to the same category should be represented by similar vectors (Xu et al., 2014;Guo et al., 2015;Hu et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016c) or be located in a low-dimensional subspace (Jameel and Schockaert, 2016).

The focus of these studies is often on the frequency of glancing at or using smartphones, and \"ignoring co-present participants\" is presupposed. However, it has also been shown that smartphone use can be initiated and carried out as a parallel side activity [19], as a resource for co-present interaction [10,30,74,77], or in the context of a joint smartphone-based activity [9,38,75]. As a general principle, it is crucial to distinguish between convergent and divergent smartphone use [8].

The frst part of the defnition of phubbing is \"focusing on a mobile device.\" A problem with this formulation is that it implies that people can focus exclusively either on their mobile devices or on their ongoing co-present interaction. However, studies relying on interaction analysis show that people can do multiple things simultaneously by dividing their attention between main and side involvements [27]. The topic of multiple engagements has already been addressed in studies analyzing how people interact with co-present others while driving [33,62], drinking [40], performing massage [67], and so on. In studies addressing multiactivity [32], researchers reveal practices participants employ to maintain several courses of action and make their multiple involvements recognizable for co-present others. Rather than assuming \"main\" and \"side\" characteristics of diferent simultaneously unfolding activities, they aim to understand how participants themselves collaboratively negotiate \"mainness\" and \"sideness\" [63] of diferent activities moment-by-moment [50]. This approach to understanding multiple involvements has also been used to study mobile device use in transport situations [33,49] and in face-to-face interactions [18,19,30]. Analysis of naturally occurring interactions revealed that \"the allocation of one's attention to engagement in one's smartphone and co-present others is not either-or; rather, it manifests in degrees through the allocation of interactive resources such as one's words, gaze, and corporal confgurations, in relation to the device and collocated others\" [52]. Therefore, in this study, instead of assuming that smartphone users ignore co-present others, we analyze how they accomplish smartphone use successively or concurrently with other activities, how they make their engagement recognizable and accountable to others, how the character of multiactivity is collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants, and how multiactivity is dissolved.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_0": "Smartphones have become an integral part of people's daily lives in many countries around the world.

Consequently, researchers have raised concerns about the negative efects of pervasive smartphone use on the quality of face-to-face interactions [2,20,80], hence the term phubbing (phone snubbing), which refers to situations when co-present others are overshadowed by smartphone use. So far, most of the existing studies on smartphone use have been based on surveys, interviews, or data collected in experimental settings. One problem with these approaches is that they often fail to take the interactional context of smartphone use into account. The generalizability of much-published research on this issue is also problematic, as the mainstream approaches do not consider when, how, and by whom smartphone use is initiated (i.e., its communicational motivation) and how co-present others then react to this. The necessity to analyze smartphone use in real-life contexts has been recently emphasized [15,37], but relatively few studies have focused on smartphone use in natural communication settings [21,53,71].", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

Participants often initiate smartphone use after some signs of disengagement are already visible, for example, the absence of talk and/or lack of mutual gaze orientation. Smartphone use can also be initiated as a \"now-relevant\" or a \"now-or-never\" activity, or specifcally with the purpose of suspending/abandoning ongoing interaction in order to avoid conficts or awkward moments. While audible notifcations and phone calls can have a disruptive efect on co-present interactions due to their unpredictability [85], in the current data set, participants rarely attended to a summons at the moment of its occurrence. Individual smartphone-based activities were usually delayed until an appropriate sequential slot presented itself. If the goal is to understand the predictors and consequences of phubbing in real-life situations, it is imperative to take these situational and interactional factors into account, along with psychological factors.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_14": "Breaks. While previous studies argue that young adults need guidance to control smartphone use and phubbing [16], the current study demonstrates that participants in interactions are capable of managing smartphone use and its possible negative efects on the interaction. Generally, smartphone users return to the ongoing conversation themselves, while co-present others continue talking without problematizing their smartphone use (Example 1). Smartphone users can also be brought back to the ongoing interaction by co-present other(s), who can, for example, introduce a new topic or ask the smartphone user about the type of on-screen activity. However, they rarely problematize one's smartphone use and usually do it in a humorous way, as shown in previous studies [39] and confrmed in this study (Example 2). One important fnding that video-based analysis of phubbing reveals is that smartphone use per se is rarely problematized or oriented to as problematic by participants themselves. However, depending on the interactional context and the type of the user's on-screen activity, smartphone users' disengagement can be problematized with reference to smartphone use. Smartphone breaks can be dissolved diferently based on the interactional context that preceded them. If there is a person who is expected to talk prior to the emergence of a \"smartphone break, \" they are usually held responsible for resuming joint interaction (Example 3). However, if \"smartphone breaks\" follow disengagement, smartphone users are left with no ongoing interaction to which they can return (Example 4). In these cases, smartphones are often used as resources for introducing new topics or activities and, therefore, for restoring a common interactional space.", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_metadata": "Authors: Hyunchul Lim, Jungmin Chung, Changhoon Oh, Sohyun Park, Joonhwan Lee, B.

The current study enhances our understanding of what has been called contagious phone use [22] or reciprocal phubbing [12,39,58]. This phenomenon was previously interpreted as a response to a discontented action [12], as part of face-saving work [58], or as a way of establishing symmetry in interaction [39]. Although we do not reject these earlier fndings, we do demonstrate one more possible explanation for reciprocal smartphone use. In fact, the reasons and contexts for reciprocated smartphone use can be quite similar to those of initial self-initiated smartphone use (e.g., disengagement). During dyadic interactions, for instance, if the other person is using their smartphone and displays disengagement, the device can serve as a time-passing tool (Example 3). \"Smartphone breaks, \" that is, situations in which all co-present participants are temporarily engaged in their own smartphone-based activities, also emerge in the context of prior mutual disengagement (Example 4).", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_metadata": "Authors: Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Roberto Navigli | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_metadata": "Authors: Wenjian Huang, T.

Multimodal interaction analysis can provide additional insights into reciprocal phubbing. In this subsection, we demonstrate that the reasons for reciprocating phubbing are often very similar to the reasons for initiating smartphone use in general.

Phubbing has been studied in a variety of different settings and types of relationships: professional settings [7], family interactions [7,42], and interactions with romantic partners [7,24,34,56], with friends and acquaintances [2], and even with virtual agents [68]. Despite the diferences in context, phubbing is defned quite similarly in these studies and usually consists of two parts: (1) ignoring co-present other(s) and (2) focusing on the mobile device instead. Prior studies have reported that smartphone-based multitasking (e.g., texting during face-to-face interactions) leads to lower romantic intimacy with partners [6], lower conversation intimacy [59,76,87], a decrease in the level of perceived quality of relationships [34,56], and a lower level of perceived interaction quality [13,86]. Phubbing is also associated with individuals experiencing a sense of social exclusion [17]. In light of the growing number of studies on this topic, several literature reviews have been conducted to summarize fndings about various phubbing practices and their predictors and impacts [5,11]. While some researchers claim that phubbing has become a social norm [12], other scholars argue that it has not yet become a normative practice despite being widespread [2]. It is also paradoxical that survey participants often admit to using technology in interactions with others, while also claiming that such behavior is ofensive and negatively impacts interpersonal interactions [2,7]. In part, these discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that most phubbing research uses quantitative methods, and the most frequent data collection instrument is a questionnaire [11], which often disregards the interactional context of device use. More recent studies underline the importance of studying phubbing in the context of participants' daily environments. It has been shown that phubbing behavior can be assessed diferently by the phubbee (the person receiving phubbing) depending on the context: phubbing does not damage relationships on its own, but the negative impact of phubbing is attributed to negative appraisals, which can vary across diferent situations [24]. There are, however, relatively few studies that analyze actual instances of solitary smartphone use in naturally occurring interactions [52,70]. In this study, we therefore attempt to understand phubbing as it unfolds in real-life situations. However, phubbing must frst be deconstructed and reinterpreted through the lens of interaction analysis, which is done in the next subsection.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_metadata": "Authors: Yasha Iravantchi, Mayank Goel, Chris Harrison | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis. We adopt a sensor fusion approach by taking both 'surface waves' (i.e., vibrations through surface) and 'sound waves' (i.e., vibrations through air) into analysis to improve sensing resolution. We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_9": "The TDOA approach. For localizing the acoustic signal, the most prevalent approach, which we also use in this work, is time difference of arrival (TDOA) analysis [10,24,36,37,48,49]. For example, PingPongPlus [24] instruments four contact microphones located at the outermost corners of the desired interactive region. When a Ping-Pong ball falls inside of this region, the signal arrives to the four sensors at different times, enabling a hyperbolic intersection localization. Likewise, SurfaceVibe [36] also uses four geophones in a similar setup to enable two interaction types, tap and swipe, on multiple types of surfaces. Instead of instrumenting the surfaces, Toffee [48] augments the mobile devices and laptops with four piezo sensors and demonstrates accurate resolution of the bearings of touch events around the devices, although the evaluation considers only a single user. Besides TDOA analysis, SoundCraft [17] instead uses a target signal subspace method, by adopting the basic idea of Multiple Signal Classification technique, which can localize acoustic signals even in noisy environment.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_0": "We assume the distance between Sensor A and B to be 4 cm (a common wrist length), the distance between Sensor A and Tap D to be 18cm (a common hand size), the distance between the two taps (C and D, E and F) to be 4cm, and the speed of sound to be 340m/s. Populating the equations with these numbers, we get the differences of two TDOAs along X axis and Y axis as 25.8\u00b5s and 3.6\u00b5s respectively. This is why X axis localization is easier than Y axis.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \"idle\" fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_8": "To track the motion of secondary fingers in the air, the ring-like device prototypes were worn on the thumb and the index finger. We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_5": "Choice of consumer-grade recording hardware.

The beep is regarded as an impulse signal, and the user has no explicit requirement of temporal preciseness W t . In other words, only D t (interonset interval, IOI) is controlled. The model divides the cognitive process in synchronisation tasks into two parts: an internal time-keeping process is followed by a motor response with time delay. Both time-keeping precision and motor delay are assumed to be stochastic and separately represented by additive random noise with a mean and variance. Noise components can be extracted from a tapping experiment by examining autocorrelation in consecutive asynchronies [39]. The variance of the time-keeping process linearly increases with IOI [27,29], There is a similarity here to the model of ballistic movements in the spatial domain, in which the SD of end location linearly increases with target amplitude D s . We will use this linearity as a primary assumption in our model. By contrast, variance in motor responses remained relatively constant and lower than time-keeping variance. This implies that variance in motor responses dominates in fast tapping (IOI sub-250 ms).", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_para_1": "Some eyes-free input methods for smartwatches have been proposed [15,3,4,16].

In other words, the user is asked to move as quickly as possible to hit the target. Fitts introduced the concept of index of difficulty: M T = a + bID s = a+b log 2 (2D s /W s ). Wobbrock et al. [40] analysed Fitts' law to derive a model of error rates with three task requirements mixed in the temporal and spatial domain: target size D s , target width W s , and temporal target distance D t . As this paper does, they predicted error rates, because there was an explicit requirement to maintain a temporal distance to the target D t . Besides, when the spatial requirement W s is relaxed from Fitts' task, targeting becomes more open-loop-like. Gan and Hoffman [9] proposed a model to predict M T when the goal is to hit a large target at distance D s . Hoffman's law originally predicted M T = a + b \u221a D s .

However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated.

While significant research has been conducted in the storm risk community on how people receive, seek, and utilize risk information, given the importance of computing technologies and social media in these activities, human-centered design stands to make important contributions to this area. Drawing on an extensive literature review and 48 interviews with hurricane experts and members of the public, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a broad overview of hurricane risk communication. We then offer a set of guiding insights to inform HCI research work in this domain. Finally, we identify 6 opportunities that future human centered design work might pursue. In sum, this paper offers an invitation and a starting point for HCI to take up the problem of hurricane risk communication.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_10": "Second, HCI scholars have developed an active area of research in the areas of visualizing uncertainty. This work may be relevant to developing alternative ways of accomplishing the risk communication goals of the cone graphic and spaghetti models [44] [54] [60]. One study has even explored how certain forms of graphical interaction may support science education goals by helping users learn to improve their ability to evaluate uncertainty in other contexts [53]. Research in the feld of risk communication has argued for almost two decades that providing users with information about the degree and source of uncertainty in forecast models improves their trust in information sources and supports decision-making [88]. Yet more work remains to be done to develop approaches to doing so that inform rather than confuse users. ", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_4": "HCI research has also examined online risk communication as it relates to public health crisis events. For example, Pine et al found that ofcial risk communication about COVID-19 in the United States was too often contradictory, complex, or changing, so that the public often turned to their own social networks in the absence of clear signals from ofcials [103]. A study of online conversations during the Zika epidemic highlighted the challenges citizens faced with authoritative risk information and the countermeasures they took to fnd trustworthy guidance for their decision-making [46]. The extreme uncertainty of the Zika epidemic gave rise to multidimensional and speculative risk perceptions, highlighting the need for a more participatory approach to risk communication that engages laypeople/members of the public along with experts [47]. Such fndings demonstrate the opportunity for HCI to contribute to the improvement of risk communication during hurricane events, both on-and ofine.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_18": "Over the past fve decades tropical cyclones have, on average, killed 10,000 people and caused $15 billion dollars in damage a year [37]. These impacts are only predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change and continued population growth and urban development in storm prone areas [55] [67]. Improving the ways in which science can help at-risk communities understand, prepare for, and mitigate the impacts of major storm events is thus a critical task, and one to which HCI can make important contributions. In this paper we provide an overview of an initial research agenda for HCI that focuses on communicating risk information to the public during the predictive phase of storms. As HCI research in this space continues to develop, we anticipate that further opportunities will develop and that we may also take on related questions, such as risk communications focused primarily in urban and regional planning decisions aimed at mitigating storm risk, rather than taking protective action in the lead-up period. Inasmuch as we argue that HCI can support this agenda, we also believe that our feld would be enriched through focus on these issues. Questions of representation of uncertainty, trust in information, and the human relationship to the environment are critical areas of work across HCI that research into tropical storm risk communication may inform.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_13": "Much of the discussion about uncertainty in science and risk communication treats uncertainty as problematic, or as a challenge to be overcome [119]. Hence there is intense focus on identifying and reducing sources of uncertainty in risk models and developing efective means of communicating the remainder. While such eforts are no doubt essential, there are several strands of work in HCI that explore the benefts of engaging with uncertainty. Research in the area of ambiguous design, for example, has argued that purposeful inclusion of ambiguity can support deeper appropriation of complex technologies by users [42]. Game design rests on careful use of uncertainty to create tension, challenge, and engagement from participants [25]. Prior crisis informatics research in food risk visualization has explored the role of serious games and deliberative risk communication strategies to support deeper understanding of complex information about disaster [116]. Such approaches also show promise in the context of tropical storm risk communication [12].", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_14": "When considering uncertainty in the context of hurricane risk communication, several approaches can be adopted from HCI. First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties. Thus, there is much opportunity for HCI and information visualization research to continue studying efective methods for uncertainty visualization approaches for hurricane forecasts [20] [105] [109] [113] [133].", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_11": "HCI has already contributed important fndings to understanding how people share visual imagery of storm impacts on social media, including the importance of contextualization to one's local area and of representing uncertainty [11]. These fndings may be built upon further through augmented or virtual reality techniques that have been experimented with in science education and visualizations about climate change and disaster [10]. The Weather Channel has also used these tools to communicate disaster risk to the public [56]. AR/VR tools have also been used by HCI research into science education [106]. Such approaches ofer the potential to deliver contextualized risk information to the public in ways that includes familiar local landmarks and settings, which is thought to improve user understanding and trust. Finally, including information about vulnerable communities or public resources is another tactic that may be useful. Communication of vulnerability ahead of storm arrival could provide additional information to users about potential impacts of the storm in ways that support decision-making or improved understanding of hurricane risk.", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_5": "Human-centered design (HCD) is an area of research and practice that is being taken up in multiple domains as a means of understanding the distinct needs, capacities, and contexts of use for a range of technologies.

Other domains where human centered design approaches have made contributions include education [64], sustainability [65], personal informatics [38], mental health [34], and accessibility [8]. Through taking a broader perspective of problems and focusing on the experiences of people most impacted by the problem, HCD can open avenues for multiple kinds of insights and solutions into complex design challenges.

For example, by using social media data from people directly impacted by hurricanes, Metaxa-Kakavouli et al. [77] found that evacuation behavior is associated with social capital, i.e. the breadth of one's extended social network. In other work, Bica et al. [11] classifed hurricane risk images shared by authorities on social media throughout the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season and described their prevalence, difusion, and reception by the public.

In addition, ofcial information created and disseminated by hurricane experts at NOAA or local emergency management ofces is increasingly competing for the public's attention with other sources of information including mainstream and social media and information received from neighbors, friends, and family-members. Another challenge is that many contextual factors, including prior experience with storms, socioeconomic status, and behaviors of an individual's social networks, infuence people's decisions to prepare, evacuate, or take other protective actions prior to storms [15] [32].

Indeed, prior work has demonstrated that risk information can \"hide the basic normative questions essential to ... decision-making in the mystique of statistics\" [39]. One efect of this is to create a counterproductive hierarchy between experts and the local knowledge and lived experiences of at-risk communities [2] [58] [75]. However, any efort to quantify complex phenomena such as the potential impact of storms on local communities will necessarily involve judgment calls and value-laden decisions [118]. These concerns align with work in HCI and critical data studies that seek to unpack and mitigate the various ways in which data standards, algorithms, and other socio-technical processes contain biases and assumptions that refect the interest and worldviews of those who create them, simultaneously excluding and marginalizing other perspectives [9] [43] [62] [63] [94]. Risk communication is often conceived of as a process whereby experts, such as forecasters and meteorologists, transfer knowledge about potential threats to the public for their response [4] [30]. This one-way communication, referred to variously as the broadcast, defcit, or transmission model, has come under scrutiny from various directions, but is still largely characteristic of many risk communication processes [30] [114]. Critiques of these approaches argue that science and risk-intensive protective action design problems are inherently interdisciplinary and require more knowledge than any single person or discipline possesses [3] and that knowledge relevant to hurricane risk is distributed among residents of afected areas as much as scientists and other experts. New insights, ideas, and methods for communicating and activating hurricane risk information will arise by bringing diferent, even contested, points of view together to create a shared or at least collective understanding among those participants of a hurricane decision-making process. Risk-informed decision-making should be conceived of as a series of personal interactions with information tools and artifacts mediated by familiar groups of people and knowledge communities [3]. New technologies, artifacts, workfows, and participatory processes should aford those exposed to hurricane risk to contribute to the framing and resolving the complex problem of risk communication and protective action.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_metadata": "Authors: Yasha Iravantchi, Mayank Goel, Chris Harrison | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

Drawing upon classic scholarship in disaster studies, crisis informatics has highlighted the important ways in which members of the public play important roles in circulating and reinterpreting ofcial disaster information [125]. This research has also discussed the public's use of technologies in coordinating informal, emergent citizen response to disasters [132]. As with risk communications, crisis informatics has documented the vital role of journalists in interpreting and broadcasting expert information about disaster [28]. While the feld is best known for its contributions to understand the role of social media during moments of crisis [100] [107], other work in the area has looked at a wider range of technologies and temporalities relevant to hurricane risk including research into disaster risk models [116], post-disaster impact assessments [116], and the design of smartphone applications for creating and sharing disaster information [59].", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_metadata": "Authors: E.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude.

We propose monoQA, which uses a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader. Our model, which is based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) text generation model, is fine-tuned simultaneously for both reranking (in order to improve the precision of the top retrieved passages) and extracting the answer. Unlike previous work, monoQA makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task, followed by the other tokens for the answer extraction task, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Our contributions are summarised as follows: (1) we leverage Multi-Task Learning with a text generation model by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure to effectively addresses the ORConvQA task; (2) using two different ORConvQA datasets, we compare our model to two strong baselines from the literature, and show that our MTL reranker and generative reader approach yields the best F1, Recall, MRR, Figure 2: An example dialog and relevant passages from the ORConvQA dataset (Qu et al., 2020). and MAP performance improvements over the strongest baseline with statistically significant improvements ranging from +5.70% to +23.34%; (3) the proposed MTL model combining the reranker and generative reader significantly outperforms and is twice as fast for inference than the individual application of the monoT5 and UnifiedQA models for reranking and extracting the answer.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_10": "In the following, we discuss related work and position our contribution in relation to Conversational Question Answering and Multi-Task Learning. Conversational Question Answering: This is a conversational search task, where the system needs to correctly interpret a question in the context of an ongoing conversation. Most research on conversational QA focuses on conversational response ranking tasks (Dalton et al., 2019(Dalton et al., , 2020(Dalton et al., , 2021 and extractive QA tasks (Choi et al., 2018;Reddy et al., 2019;Qu et al., 2019b;Yeh and Chen, 2019). Qu et al. (2020) were first to define the task of Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (OR-ConvQA), where the system is required to learn to retrieve top relevant passages from a large collection before extracting answers from the passages. To address the ORConvQA task, Qu et al. (2020) proposed a three-stage pipeline: (1) a retriever, (2) a reranker, and (3) a reader. Later, Qu et al. (2021) introduced a learned weakly-supervised training approach to address the problem of accessing gold passages during the training of the model on the OR-CoQA dataset in (Qu et al., 2020). One particular problem is coarse ranking, where the reranker of Qu et al. (2020) only takes the top-ranked passages as input. This makes the whole pipeline suffers from this coarse ranking, especially for situations when the golden passages are not retrieved in the top-ranked passages. Liang et al. (2022) addressed this issue by adding a post-ranker module that can push more relevant passages to the reader. However, these works typically approach reranking and reading as classification tasks to find an answer span for retrieved passages (start/end positions). Instead, we use a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader in order to directly extract the answers for the users instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_2": "Recently, Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which is a method of learning multiple different but related tasks at the same time, has become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model (Qu et al., 2019b).

In this manner, the network structure is shared between the reranker and the reader. Doing this, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021 also typically approach reranking and extractive reading as classification tasks, with two fully-connected layers (one for the reranker and reader, respectively) added to find an answer span for the retrieved passages (start/end positions) as well as to predict the relevance score of the question to the passage as shown in Figure 1(a).

Such approaches also typically tackle reranking and reading as classification tasks. On the other hand, recent text generation models, such as monoT5 and UnifiedQA, have been shown to respectively yield impressive performances in passage reranking and reading. However, no prior work has combined monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model that directly extracts the answers for the users instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage. In this paper, we investigate the use of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to improve performance on the ORConvQA task by sharing the reranker and reader\u2019s learned structure in a generative model.

The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever. We also consider other recent existing bi-encoder passage retrievers such as TCT-ColBERT (Lin et al., 2021b, 2020a and CQE (Lin et al., 2021a) as baseline passage retrievers.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_8": "Three-stage pipelines: (a) The first ORCon-vQA system has been proposed by Qu et al.

This is a crucial baseline to compare with our monoQA model in order to evaluate the reranker and reader performances. We reproduce the MTL of the reranker and reader models and its evaluation results provided by Qu et al.

It is deployed by using three models in the pipeline for comparison with our ORConvQA system, which employs a MTL of the reranker and reader.

In particular, Khashabi et al. (2020) introduced the UnifiedQA model, which has been shown to yield impressive performances on many extractive QA datasets. However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_5": "The right part of Figure 3 presents our proposed model, which uses T5, a large pre-trained language models designed for text generation.

To adopt an MTL approach to a text generation model for jointly learning from both passage reranking and answer extraction, the MTL model makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task and the follow-up tokens for the answer extraction task. In particular, when fine-tuning the T5 model for a downstream task, we use Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify the model by using a taskspecific prompt together with the input . We deploy a T5 model to capture the relation between the rewritten question q r of the current question q c and the passage p as shown in the right part of Figure 3.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. We explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence, where the evidence for each candidate is based on a small set of strong relations, rather than relations to all other entities in the document. The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB.

These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex.

We propose to adopt an argumentative approach to identify which premises allow such legitimization. To showcase this approach, we created four short narratives describing cyberattacks involving generic users and covering different motives for the attacks: profit, recreation, revenge, and ideology. A sample of 16 participants read the four narratives and was afterward interviewed to express their position on the attacks described.

Assigning someone the status of the victim or the ofender is the result of an interpretive, interactional process [23] [56]. identifying the premises on which favorable argumentation rests would help to understand how lay citizens could legitimize (or condemn) cyberattacks. (We prefer to use the term legitimized over neutralized or justifed/excused because the former term assumes a cognitive model that is not necessary to our purpose; the terms justifed or excused only refer to a subset of neutralization techniques, and are then not adequate to refer to all techniques in general [49].) To showcase this argumentative approach to legitimization, we study the position on cyberattacks of a small sample of university students, who represent a typical participant in the literature on cybercrime [5]. The investigation uses a refexive thematic analysis [6] [7], which is open to the arguments spontaneously used by the participants. The purpose is not to map the entire argumentative space used by university students to make sense of cyberattacks, but to illustrate an argumentative approach and draw some cybersecurity implications from the results.

An example is provided by the debate on Facebook's policy on users' personal data: their policy was justifed in the name of the free, valuable service it provided but also criticized in the name of transparency [41]. Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy. A controversy is an issue that can inspire opposite positions and can be framed within opposite categories [3], [21], [29], [57].

This allowed them to use the arguments that spontaneously occurred while answering and to take articulated and ambivalent positions as they were considering various sides of the attack.

Notoriety, also called prestige, consists of pursuing \"media attention, bragging, and the quest for fame\" ( [45], p. 100). Revenge is the search for compensating a tort sufered by the attacker. We excluded notoriety and curiosity from this original set of four motives because they did not ft our purposes: we were interested in cases involving lay people in the attack and not in a single attacker wanting to gain popularity or test their talent.

Instead, criminals keep some commitments to the dominant values of society and use some techniques to conciliate them with their criminal acts. Sykes and Matza identifed fve such techniques: denying the responsibility, denying the negativity of the efects, turning the victim or the condemners into culprits, or appealing to higher values [53]. Their ideas have been extensively used in the study of criminal behavior, included within various theoretical frameworks [33], and re-elaborated by Scott and Lyman's theory of accounts [49]. They have also been applied to the study of cybercrime, and evidence of recourse to all fve types of neutralization techniques has been found so far in research on hackers [24]. When it comes to understanding lay citizens' participation in cyberattacks, which is the topic of this paper, Sykes and Mazda's theory suggests that the distinction between a community of criminals and the community of law-abiding citizens is culturally more blurred than one might assume. One does not need to give up all values of the dominant society to legitimize their illegal behaviors.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

In 2018 in the U.S., about 6,000 postsecondary schools employed nearly 4 million [70] and served 16.6 million enrolled undergraduate students [71]. These are unlike other workplaces because of their mission of academic freedom -the freedom to teach, to learn, to publish, and to inquire [4,46,72]. Consequently, IT strategies for securing the information network-in-use [73] is likely to center on intrusion detection [30] and to not include top-down methods of controlling user behavior (such as social media use policies, internet firewalls, or monitoring for data loss prevention). Some institutions use a federated IT model, which allows for subunits of the university such as schools or departments to hire IT staff and operate their own systems to, in part, \"enable research, teaching and community service\" [74]. They will tolerate or encourage CYOD and self-management of IT for their workforce, which is a mix of traditional in-office employees and of remote and/or mobile workers such as \"digital nomads\" [16,29,40]. For non-IT users, this could result in \"shadow security,\" workarounds to official rules and setups that help employees manage the risks they understand while getting their jobs done [35].

Anecdotally, we know of such \"buddies\" setting up office hours or sitting with their assigned workgroup for one or more days per week. This method of supplementing \"self-serve\" online guidance and the on-demand help desk could help to prevent unintentional insider threat (UIT) [21] resulting from insecure practices, while not imposing more burdens on academic employees. It also could provide an emotional bond with an IT professional that reframes their role to be of a peer rather than an authority figure. This approach seems like the best alternative to implementing a more-controlled, top-down approach to security, which is not likely to be accepted or adopted in this environment due to the culture of academic freedom."}}

The method is used to factor a complex neural model into its functional components, which are comprised of sets of co-firing neurons that cut across layers of the network architecture, and which we call neural pathways. The function of these pathways can be understood by identifying correlated task level and linguistic heuristics in such a way that this knowledge acts as a lens for approximating what the network has learned to apply to its intended task. As a case study for investigating the utility of these pathways, we present an examination of pathways identified in models trained for two standard tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Recognizing Textual Entailment.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_4": "Many previous approaches have analyzed individual neurons or architectures of specific neural networks with gradient methods (Karpathy et al., 2015;Bach et al., 2015;Arras et al., 2017). However, we propose an approach that enables abstraction above the surface structure of a network architecture, enabling a relaxation of the assumption of an direct link between structure and function. To accomplish this abstraction, we employ a simple approach to identify what we conceptualize as emergent neural pathways, which are specific sets of co-firing neurons that work together as the model makes predictions on the data. To understand the specifics of the function performed by the functional group, we align activation patterns through the group per instance with patterns of relevance for task and linguistic knowledge.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_0": "This method, which can be applied simply in a purely post-hoc analysis, independent of the training process, can enable both understanding of individual models and comparison across models. The interpretation process enables investigation of which identified functional groups correspond to linguistic or task level heuristics that may be employed in well understood non-neural methods for performing the task. Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models.

The linear probes indicate that the information about what type of reasoning is required for a task, which is hypothesized to be encoded in the models, was distinctly encoded in each model, but to a greater extent in the decomposable attention model. The connection between the pathways and the linear probes was less strong, however. This indicates that despite the models having an encoding of the knowledge observed by the probe, it is likely a byproduct of a different function that is being approximated by the neural network. The pathways were created by analyzing which neurons behave cohesively, indicating a subprocess within the network. However, these subprocesses do not correspond strongly to any of the tested features. Consequences of this finding could be an indication that the model is 'cheating' on the task and has some inductive bias that is beneficial to the task independent from the task as envisioned by the creators. Otherwise, if many models demonstrate this behavior, the task or dataset may be insufficient to induce the desired learning behavior in neural models. This is consistent with recent highly domain specific analyses of this task (Gururangan et al., 2018;Glockner et al., 2018;Poliak et al., 2018).", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse textual expressions as executable programs composed of learnable neural modules (Andreas et al., 2016b;Johnson et al., 2017a,b;Hu et al., 2017a). Each of these modules are specialized to compute basic reasoning tasks and can be assembled to perform complex and compositional reasoning. (Andreas et al., 2016b) used dependency trees (Zhu et al., 2013) to generate the execution layouts. (Andreas et al., 2016a) proposed dynamic NMNs that learns and adapts the structure of the execution layouts to the question. (Johnson et al., 2017b) proposed homogeneous (IEP) and generic neural modules, unlike fixed and hand-crafted neural module, in which the semantics of each neural module is learnt during training. IEP model achieves promising performance on CLEVR dataset. (Liu et al., 2019) proposed IEP-Ref by extending IEP model to CLEVR-Ref+ dataset and outperformed all the prior works. Although, compositional by design, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow and fail to ground novel combinations of known linguistic constructs (Bahdanau et al., 2019). The major difference between our work and these prior works of NMN is that we explicitly parametrize and contextualize the neural modules by jointly attending over the visual and textual inputs.

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_metadata": "Authors: Netta Ofer, Idan David, H.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_metadata": "Authors: Prafulla Kumar Choubey, A.

A trained language model learns a function to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the surrounding sequence of words used in the text. There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_metadata": "Authors: Ella Rabinovich, Masih Sultani, S.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

summarization (Laban et al., 2022;Honovich et al., 2022). Perhaps most similarly, Jung et al. (2022) use NLI to estimate constraints between factual statements produced by GPT-3. These prior approaches support our intuition for using NLI models to improve logical consistency among batches of answers. While the authors explore applications of this framework to multi-step reasoning for True/False questions or statements, our work focuses on applying this methodology to more gen-Figure 2: An example factor graph for a simplified batch with two questions, q1 = What is the capital of Afghanistan? and q2 = What is the capital of Georgia?. Although Tbilisi is the most likely answer for both questions, the assignment of variables that is best under the estimated contradiction constraint flips the answer to the first question to Kabul. The top-2 answer choices for each question are sampled from the base model, and a soft contradiction constraint is detected between variables z1 (representing the truth of the answer Tbilisi for q1) and z3 (representing the truth of the answer Tbilisi for q2).", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

We show that this model is not only compatible with classical dynamic programming techniques, but also admits a novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of the input. We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the French Treebank (82.23 F1).", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_5": "Our approach exploits and integrates two core semantic relations: 1) coherence of the sentences given the claim; 2) entailment relation between the claim and each sentence, which are described more specifically below. Coherence Evaluation: According to the coherence theory of truth, the truth of any (true) proposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of propositions (Young, 2018). In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency. Textual Entailment: Entailment is used to measure whether a piece of evidence semantically infers a given claim. We propose an entailmentbased attention component that can be pre-trained to capture entailment relations (Dagan et al., 2010;Bowman et al., 2015) based on sentence pairs labeled with NLI-specific classes: entails, contradicts and neutral. This pre-trained component together with the entire claim verification framework then will be trained end-to-end to attend on the salient sentences for inferring the claim.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

Kling provided rich insights on the \"cooperative\" and \"collaborative\" nature of social computing and the need to tie design, use, and technological impact together among stakeholders [66]. CSCW, HCI and ICT have historically had a relationship with participatory design (PD) and innovation-related programs and policymaking by specific political concerns [62,[65][66][67]122]. Jackson et al. [62] recognized that there is a disconnection among research, design, and practice in the field of CSCW and argued for a holistic orientation, proposing an interconnected \"knot model\" (among design, use, and collaboration with organizations within public policy systems) with a focus on policy, practice, and design. The role of policy design was also investigated by Jackson and colleagues, [63] who emphasized the need for collaboration and mutual learning between scientific study and policy to successfully navigate design, infrastructure, and organizational collaboration complexities. They highlighted that traditional CSCW is more focused on \"implication for design\" than \"implication for policy\" in regard to ambitions of long-term social impact. Similarly, Freeman et al. (2017) [42] pointed out the scarcity of empirical studies between design and policy contexts in HCI and CSCW.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_metadata": "Authors: Nikhila Nyapathy, R.

We raise this as a critical challenge for ICT and HCI researchers, as this tendency to create new technologies raises a tension between their central priorities of \"innovations\" and \"sustainability. \" For instance, while policy and program makers have been also pursuing development of novel technology innovations for program management, our participants have advocated the need for more evidence-based sustainable program development. This intention create additional new technologies is a threat where questions of sustainability and scalability of those technologies are substantive, leading to many instances of technological innovations that fall under the heading of \"solutionism. \" This tendency is often cited in social and political science critiques as \"technology solutionism\" or the \"technology fix. \" In recent HCI design research, fixing problems that don't exist and proposing\"quick fixes\" or \"silver bullets\" for complicated social, political, and environmental challenges are criticized as \"solutionist\" [18,19,75,86]. The \"technosolutionism\" ideology was critiqued by Morozov [85], who pointed out the political tendency to believe blindly in the ability of technology to solve challenges with innovative design. On democratizing the potential of the internet and ICT, Morozov also highlighted a critical point of debate on political transformation in digital societies, expressing skepticism toward governments' ability to promote democracy through the internet in the West, adding that \"techno-solutionism\" ignores debates about politics, history, culture, actual needs and challenges, and people's capacities to adopt new technologies [85].", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_metadata": "Authors: R.

They commonly invoke innovation through bottom-up approaches to empower communities within development contexts [35]. However, the inability to sustain a more extended period to scale up technology-based programs and projects remain as absolute constraints in Global South countries [31,51,54,120,123,125]. It has also been recognized that for digital innovation to be successful and sustainable, the wider stakeholder landscape needs to be considered alongside local practices and participatory design processes [21]. The importance of understanding the collaborative nature of solution research, design, and use and collaboration with decision-making stakeholders has been emphasized by several researchers in CSCW and HCI [37,61,66,72,73,109]. Kumar and Dell [69] go further and have demonstrated the need for a deeper understanding of how global development practitioners use innovation to generate informed practice for successful HCI4D. However, it has remained under-studied why and how the bureaucratically led policymaking process, which often involves embarking on unfounded, overestimated, and expensive technology deployments, is mismatched with the demonstrable value gained from engaging communities on the ground. Further, there is little well-articulated literature on the high-level political contexts and actors in Global South countries, such as the political visions and priorities influencing and driving Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) programs and how projects and policies change as they go through central authorities (from the government to national and international organizations) [124].", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_metadata": "Authors: A.

While many studies focus on the bottom-level local context of program implementation [6,31,120] and note the importance of understanding political analysis [123], there has been sparse reporting on the highlevel context in which policy and programs are formed. Heeks emphasized that the high rate of ICTD program failure arises from the \"design-reality gaps\" that arise from a lack of understanding of decision-makers' and program designers' contexts [53]. Overall, sufficient insights have not yet been articulated on the high-level political contexts and actors, such as the political visions and priorities influencing and driving ICTD programs and how projects and policies change as they go through a central authority (from the government to national and international organizations, including donors) [124].

Institutioning refers to working within diverse institutions [36], and is a useful frame for understanding the complexity within community-based design processes, particularly when conducting a program with a participatory design (PD) [114,115]. These scenarios are characterized as situations in which the process is constantly moving horizontally and vertically between and within diverse micro-meso and macro levels [58] and call for attention to the significant relationships between policy, institutions, and meta-cultural frames [58,115]. PD approaches in social computing are figured by a diverse group of institutions, and need to be understood in terms of the meso-and macro-level institutions that PD is dependent on and informed by [58]. Dearden and colleagues [33] also acknowledged the need to understand the institutioning involved in critical computing issues. In the debate on HCI and social innovation, they also contribute to the insufficiently studied issue of HCI designers' lack of attention past the research context to how innovations become distributed and adopted for social goods. Political issues surrounding technology, such as how decisions are made for technology adoption and scale-up in programs may be understood through the complexities of institutioning and the actors at the decision-making level [114,115], where these institutions and their individuals are broadly influenced by their own objectives and priorities, yet have to translate initiatives between designers and communities [25,26].", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_metadata": "Authors: B.

The tendency of governments and donors to push technology innovations into Global South contexts is not a new phenomenon, as discussed in literature that we highlighted in our related work section. However, distinctions between the ways in which top-down authority is invoked is necessary to clarify that the actions of high-level policymakers, government officeholders, and multinational NGOs are not necessarily antithetical to the success of development innovations. Those involved in CSCW and HCI4D have long advocated for engaging with under-represented groups and bringing under-explored topics to the fore. We extend this line of work by arguing for incorporating marginalized communities' voices as part of an engagement with program and policy makers into the decision-making process. Our findings highlight that this incorporation is often challenged by various internal and external factors in the local governing system. By considering the interactions among diverse top-down institutions [58,76,114,115] their institutioning, the intermediaries involved (such as multi-sectoral actors in government INGOs and donor agencies), and the dynamics of intermediation, we can articulate how they work and where HCI can contribute in the processes of digital innovations with and for marginalized communities. Hence, we suggest that HCI researchers develop a nuanced understanding of the policy and program-making contexts within which their intervention is placed. We suggest there is a potentially fruitful opportunity for HCI researchers to take a middle-man approach and connect the bottom-up and top-down contexts [37].", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_metadata": "Authors: Ron Wakkary, Doenja Oogjes, Henry W.

Hence, it is argued that we need a new breed of virtues that can be potentially developed through technology [79]. To achieve this, our impact on the environment should be made more tangible for us to want to develop virtuous actions we have not considered before.

The review on HCI4D by Dell and Kumar noted that, \"nearly half of the papers (128) target 'ground-level users' to respond to their specific needs and challenges\" [35]. With this, we see a significant amount of HCI4D work has been conducted in the areas of sharing agricultural communication and information with farmers [43,94], health [68,92] and nutrition for women [23,110], facilitating field tasks with health workers [100], educational technology [121], monitoring and evaluation (M&E) purposes for NGOs [11,74], and safety and security goals for women [3,5]. Furthermore, researchers have also shown that there is a big push in the Global South to transfer technologies from the West and use them in international development contexts, copying the western practice of innovation [59], which is compounded by the UN and other NGOs advocating for the innovation and use of digital technology towards achieving all SDGs [89]. While there is a definite upward trend of using ICT in most development programs and projects, an inability to sustain such innovation for an extended period after the initial research is conducted, so as to be able to scale up technology-based programs and projects, remains an absolute constraint [8,31,51,54,123,124]. In their review, Avgerou and Walsham [9] stated that \"successful examples of computerization can be found . . . but frustrating stories of systems which failed . . . are more frequent. \"", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_metadata": "Authors: Luis A.

We use 8 steps of gradient accumulation and batches made of a maximum of 1024 tokens. We evaluate the model on the validation dataset every 2000 steps, enforcing a patience of 15 evaluation rounds.

In DANN, the entire hidden layer contributes unanimously towards the source classification and domain divergence objective. Unlike DANN, our approach segregates the hidden layer where the two components of hidden layer are treated differently for different objectives. Both the source specific and common parts contribute positively to the source classification objective. However, for the domain divergence objective, the common part contributes positively (i.e., tries to minimize divergence by maximizing the domain regressor's loss); whereas, the source specific part contributes negatively (i.e., tries to maximize divergence by minimizing domain regressor's loss) Generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) build generative models to synthesize samples and falls closely in the same cat-egory due to the similar method of measuring and minimizing the discrepancy between the feature distributions.

This system supports group work and individual work and the transition between them. Agrawala et al. [2] also proposed a tabletop system with shutter glasses for multiple users. In this system, the user wears 3D glasses, and communication is interrupted. Pivot [20] provides the personal and shared views without glasses, but the quality of the image degrades as the number of users increases. MisTable [32] establishes a personal workspace with a fog screen and shared space with a tabletop display, but users are fixed at four sides of the table and must sit with a fog screen between them and the tabletop. Our system does not require 3D glasses; it can be viewed anywhere around the circular screen, and there is no loss of resolution due to the number of people increasing. Therefore, it can be used as a collaborative work interface to solve existing limitations.", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_metadata": "Authors: Kagonya Awori, M.

Researchers have been working on presenting various methods of projecting viewpoint images from multiple projectors onto a screen with narrow diffusion characteristics [33,19,18,22]. In such a multi-view 3D display, the number of viewpoints is increased to smooth changes between viewpoints, present the binocular parallax, and widen the visual field area. A uniform viewpoint distribution is necessary for extending the viewing zone over 360-degree  horizontal directions around the table. Conventional methods  of expanding the viewing area to 360 degrees around the table   are roughly divided into a time division method, like a rotation mechanism, and a space division method with multiple  displays or projectors. Jones et al. [17] proposed a time division method that presents 360-degree 3D images with a high-speed video projector and a rotating mirror covered with a holographic diffuser. Inoue et al. [14] proposed a rotating screen system that uses a microelectro-mechanical systems spatial light modulator (MEMS SLM). Takaki et al. [45] proposed a configuration that has three projectors and a rotating screen. The systems of Inoue and Takaki both use a screen that is constructed with a Fresnel lens whose optical axis is shifted to focus light at the users' positions. With a configuration that uses a rotating mirror or a screen, the users' hands cannot be brought close to the 3D objects for their own safety. Butler et al. [4] proposed a 360-degree 3D display in which hands can be brought close to a 3D object because there is a rotating screen and a highspeed digital micromirror device (DMD) projector under the two parabolic mirrors placed opposite each other, and the 3D image is imaged in the air. Lim et al. [27] proposed a similar system that uses four synchronized high-speed DMDs.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

ER is a challenging problem because mentions are often ambiguous on their own, and can only be resolved given appropriate context. For example, the mention Beirut may refer to the capital of Lebanon, the band from New Mexico, or a drinking game (Figure 1). Names may also refer to entities that are not in the KB, a problem known as NIL detection.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_1": "Since the advent of Deep Learning within the NLP community, this task has mostly been framed as a multi-label classification problem (Shahbazi et al., 2019;Broscheit, 2019), especially leveraging the bi-encoder paradigm (Humeau et al., 2020;. However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain. Finally, we also perform a thorough investigation of our system performances, providing insights and pinpointing the reasons behind our improvements via a fine-grained evaluation on different label-frequency classes.", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

Two coders labelled 4,500 unique comments with at least one of the thirteen types of essential components extracted from our theoretical analysis (see label development documentation in Section 3.4 and Appendix B). To ensure intercoder reliability and the representativeness of the sample, we performed the following procedures. First, coders discussed the developed minimal theoretic conceptualization, reviewed predefined examples for each class, and resolved any questions about the nature of the classes. Then, both coders labelled the same set of 100 random comments from the corpus, yielding a Krippendorf alpha of 0.7. After discussing prevailing differences in the coding tactics, coders learned to adjust their coding in a way that conformed more to the theoretic framework. Coders then relabelled the same corpus, yielding an intercoder reliability of 0.75. This was higher than the expected minimum for coding complicated language tasks in the literature (>0.6 -see e.g., [5,37,43,92,105,122]). Since coders' labeling practices were robust, they proceeded with the selection and labeling of further comments. Specifically, an initial sample of 1650 comments was labeled, containing 30 comments from each subreddit in the dataset. Next, a second batch of 1000 comments was annotated, which we randomly selected by stratified sampling among subreddits. To assess how many comments were necessary for an accurate classifier, we trained a preliminary language model on these 2750 comments, finding that for reliable prediction for each class, at least 300 observations were necessary. To satisfy this condition, we continued labeling comments by stratified random sampling until an annotated sample of 4500 comments was produced.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green.

If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_20": "To further control for other factors that could plausibly affect the outcome, we again used the Wayback Machine [8] to extract different moderation rules that existed in each subreddit during the investigated period. Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures.

The basic idea is to map dependency arcs from a source treebank to its target translation according to word alignments. This method, however, can suffer from imperfect alignment between source and target words. To address this problem, we investigate syntactic transfer by code mixing, translating only confident words in a source treebank. Cross-lingual word embeddings are leveraged for transferring syntactic knowledge to the target from the resulting code-mixed treebank. Experiments on University Dependency Treebanks show that code-mixed treebanks are more effective than translated treebanks, giving highly competitive performances among cross-lingual parsing methods.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

Previous research efforts generally address the ASTE task in an end-to-end fashion through the table-filling formalization, in which the triplets are represented by a two-dimensional (2D) table of word-pair relations. Under this formalization, a term-level relation is decomposed into multiple independent word-level relations, which leads to relation inconsistency and boundary insensitivity in the face of multi-word aspect terms and opinion terms. To overcome these issues, we propose Boundary-Driven Table-Filling (BDTF), which represents each triplet as a relation region in the 2D table and transforms the ASTE task into detection and classification of relation regions. We also notice that the quality of the table representation greatly affects the performance of BDTF. Therefore, we develop an effective relation representation learning approach to learn the table representation, which can fully exploit both word-to-word interactions and relation-to-relation interactions. Experiments on several public benchmarks show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performances.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_metadata": "Authors: Yice Zhang, Yifan Yang, Yihui Li, Bin Liang, Shiwei Chen, Yixue Dang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_para_3": "We categorize the baselines into four groups: tablefilling methods, span-based methods, generative methods, and other methods. Table-Filling methods represent aspect terms and opinion terms along with their sentiment relations as word-pair relations. Wu et al. (2020) propose Grid Tagging Scheme (GTS) and design an inference strategy to exploit mutual indication between different opinion factors.  propose a multi-task learning framework (OTE-MTL) to jointly extract terms and parse sentiment dependencies. Dual-Encoder (Jing et al., 2021) and TGA +SFI (Wang et al., 2021a) Table 2 lists the comparison results on the ASTE task. According to these results, our approach consistently attains the best performance, demonstrating its effectiveness. More specifically, we have following observations. (1) Our approach achieves F 1 -score improvements of 2.50%, 2.36%, 2.85%, and 2.01% on the four datasets compared with the previous best baseline model without introducing the syntactic dependency tree (Xu et al., 2021). (2) Wu et al., 2020;Jing et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021a;Chen et al., 2022), our approach shows substantial improvements in F 1 -score. These improvements in F 1 -score are more attributable to the improvements in Precision. For example, compared with Jing et al. (2021), our approach obtains F 1 -score gains of 4.80%, 2.63%, and 6.80% for Rest14, Lap14, and Rest15, while the corresponding Precision gains reach 7.58%, 6.82%, and 10.21%.

Intuitively, opinion terms are important clues when determining the sentiment polarity and could provide a more detailed sentiment description for the aspect terms. Previous work has generally concentrated on extracting aspect terms and opinion terms and classifying the sentiment expressed on the aspect term without explicitly considering the relations between aspect terms and opinion terms (He et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019;Chen and Qian, 2020). Therefore, Peng et al. (2020) propose the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) task, which is exemplified in Figure 1. In the ASTE task, a triplet consists of an aspect term, the corresponding opinion term, and the expressed sentiment. Peng et al. (2020) adopt the pipeline approach to address the ASTE task. They first decompose the ASTE task into several subtasks and then learn models separately for each subtask. A more advanced alternative is learning a joint model to exploit the interactions between different subtasks Wu et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2021a;Mao et al., 2021;Xu et al., 2021;Jing et al., 2021). Among these works, Wu et al. (2020) andJing et al. (2021) tackle the ASTE task through a tablefilling approach, where the triplets are represented by a two-dimensional (2D) table of word-pair relations. In this approach, aspect terms and opinion terms are extracted through the diagonal elements of the table, and sentiments are treated as relation tags that are represented by the non-diagonal elements of the table. This formalization enables joint learning of different subtasks in ASTE, achieving superior performance over the pipeline approach.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_2": "\u2022 We propose a new benchmark for pre-training LMs to be aware of common table-based operations by automatically synthesizing sentencetable cloze questions from WikiTables.

And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks. In the future, more data can be collected and used with advanced techniques such as ILP (Do et al., 2012), structured learning (Ning et al., 2017) or multi-sieve .

Previously, Schuster et al. (2019) studied various reasons for the surprisingly good performance of claim-only classifiers on FEVER and reported dataset idiosyncrasies to be the primary reason as opposed to world knowledge in word embeddings. However, they present only a preliminary analysis of the impact of world knowledge from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014).

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

However, there is a significant semantic and structural gap between natural language and action sequences, which makes this conversion difficult. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-enhanced complex question answering framework, called ALCQA, which mitigates this gap through question-to-action alignment and question-to-question alignment. We train a question rewriting model to align the question and each action, and utilize a pretrained language model to implicitly align the question and KG artifacts. Moreover, considering that similar questions correspond to similar action sequences, we retrieve top-k similar question-answer pairs at the inference stage through question-to-question alignment and propose a novel reward-guided action sequence selection strategy to select from candidate action sequences. We conduct experiments on CQA and WQSP datasets, and the results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and obtains a 9.88% improvements in the F1 metric on CQA dataset.

We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources.

Compared to simple questions with single or multihop of relations, complex questions have more kinds of answer types such as numeric or boolean types and require more kinds of aggregation operations like min/max or intersection/union to yield answers. Semantic parsing approaches typically map questions to intermediate logical forms such as query graphs (Yih et al., 2015;Bao et al., 2016;Bhutani et al., 2019;Maheshwari et al., 2019;Lan * Corresponding author. and Jiang, 2020;Qin et al., 2021), and further transform them into queries like SPARQL query language.

These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation.

The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB.

KVmem (Saha et al., 2018) presents a model consisting of a hierarchical encoder and a key value memory network. CIPITR  proposes to mitigate reward sparsity with auxiliary rewards and restricts the program space to semantically correct programs. CIPITR proposes two training ways, one training a single model for all question categories, denoted by CIP-ALL, and the other training a separate model for each category, denoted by CIP-SEP. NSM (Liang et al., 2017) utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality and helps find good programs by pruning the search space. MRL-CQA (Hua et al., 2020a) and MARL (Hua et al., 2020b) propose meta-reinforcement learning approaches that effectively adapts the meta-learned programmer to new questions to tackle potential distributional biases, where the former uses an unsupervised retrieval model and the latter learns it alternately with the programmer from weak supervision. NS-CQA (Hua et al., 2020c) presents a memory buffer that stores high-reward programs and proposes an adaptive reward function to improve training performance. SSRP (Ansari et al., 2019) presents a noise-resilient model that is distant-supervised by the final answer. CBR-KBQA (Das et al., 2021) generates complex logical forms conditioned on similar retrieved questions and their logical forms to generalize to unseen relations. We also compare our method with graph-based methods on WQSP dataset. STAGG (Yih et al., 2015) proposes a staged query graph generation framework and leverages the knowledge base in an early stage to prune the search space. TEX-TRAY (Bhutani et al., 2019) answers complex questions using a novel decompose-execute-join approach. QGG (Lan and Jiang, 2020) modifies STAGG with more flexible ways to handle constraints and multi-hop relations.

For machines to achieve this capability, they must be able to acquire relevant and correct commonsense for an unbounded set of situations. In this work, we cast commonsense acquisition as knowledge base construction and investigate whether large-scale language models can effectively learn to generate the knowledge  necessary to automatically construct a commonsense knowledge base (KB). Automatic KB construction is a long-standing goal of artificial intelligence research due to the difficulty of achieving high concept coverage in high-precision curated KBs (Lenat, 1995;Miller, 1995). Previous work has developed models capable of reading and extracting semi-structured text (Suchanek et al., 2007;Hoffart et al., 2013;Auer et al., 2007;Bollacker et al., 2008) and unstructured text (Dong et al., 2014;Carlson et al., 2010;Nakashole et al., 2011Nakashole et al., , 2012Niu, 2012) into relational schemas that can be queried for downstream applications.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Reusable neural network, a topic related to transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), is introduced to accelerate the model training in computer vision. One classical work is Net2Net (Chen et al., 2016), which first proposes the concept of the function-preserving transformation to make neural networks reusable. However, Net2Net randomly selects the neurons to be split. To handle this problem, some works (Wu et al., , 2020bWang et al., 2019b;Wu et al., 2020a) leverage a functional steepest descent idea to decide the optimal subset of neurons to be split. The pruning technique (Han et al., 2015) is also introduced for reusable neural networks (Feng and Panda, 2020). In this paper, we study the reusable pre-trained language model and propose a new method, bert2BERT, to accelerate the pre-training of BERT and GPT.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_metadata": "Authors: Christopher Chu, Scot Fang, Kevin Knight | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_4": "Language model pre-training (Bengio et al., 2003;Peters et al., 2018;Radford et al., 2018;Devlin et al., 2019) is another line of self-supervised learning task.

There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_para_0": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), GPT (Radford et al., 2018(Radford et al., , 2019Brown et al., 2020), ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and RoBERTa , have achieved great 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 FLOPs (1e19)  StackBERT (Gong et al., 2019) is based on the progressive training setting.

It receives increasing attentions from research communities recently, due to its broad applications in scenarios of dialogue system and educational reading comprehension (Piwek et al., 2007;. It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text. One possible reason causing the problem is that current sequenceto-sequence models learn a latent representation for the input text without explicitly modeling semantic information included. We therefore argue that modeling facts in the input text can help to alleviate the problem of existing neural QG models.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_abstract": "Existing research for question generation encodes the input text as a sequence of tokens without explicitly modeling fact information. These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation.

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_metadata": "Authors: Mingyang Zhou, Josh Arnold, Zhou Yu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_metadata": "Authors: Shaolei Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_metadata": "Authors: Yunli Wang, Yu Wu, Lili Mou, Zhoujun Li, Wen-Han Chao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_abstract": "We demonstrate a program that learns to pronounce Chinese text in Mandarin, without a pronunciation dictionary.

However, the efficacy of meta-learning crucially depends on the distribution of tasks available for training, and this is often assumed to be known a priori or constructed from limited supervised datasets. In this work, we aim to provide task distributions for meta-learning by considering self-supervised tasks automatically proposed from unlabeled text, to enable large-scale meta-learning in NLP. We design multiple distributions of self-supervised tasks by considering important aspects of task diversity, difficulty, type, domain, and curriculum, and investigate how they affect meta-learning performance. Our analysis shows that all these factors meaningfully alter the task distribution, some inducing significant improvements in downstream few-shot accuracy of the meta-learned models. Empirically, results on 20 downstream tasks show significant improvements in few-shot learning \u2013 adding up to +4.2% absolute accuracy (on average) to the previous unsupervised meta-learning method, and perform comparably to supervised methods on the FewRel 2.0 benchmark.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_para_6": "Meta-learning applications in NLP have yielded improvements on specific tasks (Gu et al., 2018;Han et al., 2018;Dou et al., 2019).

Metz et al. (2019) meta-learn an unsupervised update rule in a semisupervised framework. Bansal et al. (2020b) developed the SMLMT approach to unsupervised meta-learning in NLP. Contemporary work (Murty et al., 2021) explored the use of clustering, though focused only on natural language inference tasks. Curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) in the context of meta-learning has been unexplored in NLP, prior to this work. Jabri et al. (2019) found unsupervised curriculum to be beneficial for metareinforcement learning. We refer to Hospedales et al. (2020) for a comprehensive review of metalearning.

The model is meta-trained using the MAML algorithm (Finn et al., 2017), with learned per-layer learning rates, on the self-supervised task distributions.

All methods, except SentCluster and Cluster-ccnet, have Wikipedia as the text corpora. The sentence embeddings for SentCluster task distribution were obtained from Du et al. (2020), and consist of embeddings of about 1 billion sentences from ccnet (Wenzek et al., 2020). For this reason, we also report Cluster-ccnet that uses this same set of sentences. We found it beneficial to include 25% Frequency tasks in the Cluster task distribution and SentPair tasks are included in all other task distributions unless otherwise noted. Note that we only consider completely unsupervised meta-learning methods for fair evaluation. However our results improve over Bansal et al.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_abstract": "Most existing approaches to disfluency detection heavily rely on human-annotated corpora, which is expensive to obtain in practice.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_metadata": "Authors: Ga\u00ebl Guibon, Matthieu Labeau, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flamein, Luce Lefeuvre, C.

We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_abstract": "We demonstrate a program that learns to pronounce Chinese text in Mandarin, without a pronunciation dictionary.

Automatic metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) remain popular due to their fast and free computations. Yet, in the last few years we have seen that, as MT quality improves, automatic metrics become less reliable (Ma et al., 2019;Mathur et al., 2020). For example, in the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)'19 News Translation shared task, the winning system according to human annotators was not even in the top-5 according to BLEU (Barrault et al., 2019). On the other hand, using human assessments can be expensive, especially when evaluating multiple systems. In a real world scenario, given an arbitrary number of MT systems, one would need to evaluate them individually to find the best systems for a given language pair. However, that requires a considerable effort and there may not be enough human annotators to evaluate all the systems' translations. For instance, in the aforementioned WMT'19 shared task, many translations from the competing systems did not receive any human assessment.", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_metadata": "Authors: Ga\u00ebl Guibon, Matthieu Labeau, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flamein, Luce Lefeuvre, C.

Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1.

A telic event includes a natural endpoint (\u201cshe walked home\u201d), while an atelic event does not (\u201cshe walked around\u201d). Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

Due to the tablets\u2019 deterioration, scholars often rely on contextual cues to manually fill in missing parts in the text in a subjective and time-consuming process. We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks.

After processing, there are 1.17B, 0.6B, 7.73B sentences for Chinese (zh), German (de), and English (en), respectively.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship between social media interface design and respectful political discussion among users.1", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_metadata": "Authors: Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, D.

Although there are guidelines [36,37] that provide best practices for authoring alt text descriptions, researchers have found that these practices are often poorly suited for describing people who appear in images due to the complexities of representing gender, race, and disability [3]. Researchers have also noted that one-size-fts-all image descriptions are inadequate for addressing the information preferences of blind and low vision people, which necessitates the need for contextually relevant image descriptions [27,28]. Context can be particularly important when determining how to describe images of people, as research by Bennet et al.

The focus of our work was to expand our understanding of how the appearance of profle pictures within diferent contexts infuences the information needs of screen reader users, ultimately so that applications and platforms can provide relevant image descriptions when and how users want them. Also, by understanding the misconceptions sighted individuals have regarding profle picture alt text, we can think about how to prompt users to author descriptions that meet the needs of screen reader users. In this section, we discuss the role of profle pictures as a form of identity representation; how context infuenced information needs; the disjointed image description experiences between screen reader and sighted users; the potential of narrated image descriptions; and the unique image description challenges posed by avatars.", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_abstract": "Profile pictures can convey rich social signals that are often inaccessible to blind and low vision screen reader users. Although there have been efforts to understand screen reader users\u2019 preferences for alternative (alt) text descriptions when encountering images online, profile pictures evoke distinct information needs. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 screen reader users to understand their preferences for various styles of profile picture image descriptions in different social contexts. We also interviewed seven sighted individuals to explore their thoughts on authoring alt text for profile pictures. Our findings suggest that detailed image descriptions and user narrated alt text can provide screen reader users enjoyable and informative experiences when exploring profile pictures. We also identified mismatches between how sighted individuals would author alt text with what screen reader users prefer to know about profile pictures. We discuss the implications of our findings for social applications that support profile pictures.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_para_7": "We found that our sighted participants were often unsure about what should be included in image descriptions, and frequently questioned the importance of various details. For example, the comment by SP7 that backgrounds were not important is in opposition to the opinions expressed by our screen reader participants, who found value in the social signals provided by descriptions of backgrounds. Overall, the tendency was for our sighted participants to suggest that less information be provided. An issue at play is that our sighted participants' views on what should be included in image descriptions were typically based on their personal opinions, not on what they thought might be useful to screen reader users. Mismatches between screen reader and sighted users is an example of Problem 1 of \"Why CSCW applications fail\" presented by Grudin [11]: the disparity between who does the work and who gets the beneft. This problem is often exacerbated in accessibility contexts since the people who do the work often do not understand the needs or perspectives of the people who will beneft. Prior research has explored the efectiveness of various methods for authoring alt text for diferent types of imagery, including memes [8], charts [20], and images in PowerPoint [18].

For example, the guidelines propose that alt text for \"informative images\", like photos and illustrations, \"should be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image\" [36]. The National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) provides general guidelines for alt text, such as consider your audience, be concise, and be objective, as well as specifc description guidelines for diferent types of visual media, like maps, diagrams, and photographs [37]. Researchers have proposed strategies that build upon and improve the use of these guidelines in practice. Morash et al. [20] studied how two methods for creating alt text afected the quality of image descriptions composed by novice authors and found that a template-based approach was more efective than providing the guidelines alone. Mack et al. [18] built a prototype interface for constructing alt text in the context of Microsoft PowerPoint and found that interfaces that provided suggestions on what to include in an image description resulted in higher quality alt text.

Incorporating the framework, we have developed iChatProfile, an assistive chatbot design tool that can automatically generate a profile of an interview chatbot with quantified performance metrics and offer design suggestions for improving the chatbot based on such metrics. To validate the effectiveness of iChatProfile, we designed and conducted a between-subject study that compared the performance of 10 interview chatbots designed with or without using iChatProfile.

While response quality directly assesses the quality of user responses to an interview question, the level of user engagement quantifies how much a participant is engaged with a chatbot from multiple aspects (e.g., how long an engagement is).", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_3": "Researchers have developed various chatbots to elicit information from users through text-based conversations.

For example, a chatbot is built to interview students for effective teaming [66] and another chatbot to interview gamers for eliciting their game opinions [67].

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Based on a year-long ethnography on the contemporary transformations in religious practices in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this paper presents how the emerging \u201cdigital\u201d cattle marketplaces subdue various forms of traditional manifestations of urban religiosity during Eid-ul-Adha, the second-largest Islamic festival in the city. This paper further depicts how such secularization contributes to diminishing rural-urban linkages, affecting electoral politics, and reducing the tolerance to religious celebrations in a city. Drawing from a rich body of work in critical urban studies, postcolonial computing, and sociology of religions, we explain how such oft-overlooked embedding of secularization in computing affects the religious fabrics in the urban regions of the Global South, and discuss its implication for HCI scholarship in diversity, inclusion, and development.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_1": "While the twentieth-century world witnessed the advent of human rationality and technological progress, this century, by contrast, is experiencing a rise in religious/spiritual values and faith-based communities [31]. The massive globalization [123], intercontinental migrations [142], and forced mobilities of the refugees [98,109] have started to question diferent aspects of the modern secular urban planning systems of the West [31]. For the last few decades, the geopolitics of the religious have received a great deal of attention as the cities of diferent parts of the world are observing a rise in religious nationalism, fundamentalism, and communal violence [58]. Hence, in this era of globalization, religiosity is neither a unique 'feature' of the Global South, nor is there a dichotomy between the North and the South. However, since in the Global South, urban religion and the city coexist from the very beginning, scholars like Robert Orsi have suggested looking at the regional scholarly work from the Global South to understand the necessity of dynamic engagement of religion with the city [106].", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_15": "Our study builds on critical urban theories around modernism and secularism to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between HCI and religious values in an urban context. Our data show how our participants were experiencing a reduction of religious visibility, sensitivity, and performativity in diferent socioeconomic contexts of their urban lives in both the physical and online worlds. One of the popular strands of critical urban theory explains such reduction of religiosity as modernism's limitation to comprehend the complex entanglements of religion in the lives of urban dwellers. Our fndings are aligned with this line of critical work by various scholars (inter alia, AbdouMaliq Simone [123], Ara Wilson [133], Hancock [58], and Parthasarathy [108]), who critically address how scientifc tools and techniques reinforce a 'simplifed' version of urban life that is stripped of its complex religious and political relationships, and suppress the growth of alternative religion-backed modernities in urban contexts, especially in the Global South. While urban scholars are bringing religion to the disciplinary conversations to subjugate modernism's limitations, HCI is still struggling to go beyond implementing the scientifc rationalities and modernist assumptions to address the contextual needs of diferent religious groups [128]. An emerging group of scholars have started shedding light on these limitations of HCI, and providing important design implications to overcome them [73,103,113,128].Our study joins this scholarship, and argues that the existing praxis of urban HCI, urban computing, and related felds seldom address the needs of diferent religious groups, and religiosity hardly gets mediated through urban spatial, political, and socio-cultural design within HCI. We believe that this is essential to include religiosity-backed urban spatial politics in HCI conversations, which will create novel avenues of research and design for HCI and ICTD scholarship. Several HCI design paradigms including Value Sensitive Design (VSD) and Participatory Design (PD) might be useful to make designs more inclusive of religious values and practices. The contribution of this paper is not exactly about the 'process' of design, but about understanding the nature of modernity that is being extended through the use of digital tools and techniques. Thus, this paper connects HCI literature on urban HCI to a rich thread of work in social science and STS around the criticism of scientifc modernity [88], epistemic pluralism in design [51], and the appropriation of material infrastructure in urban areas [43].", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_4": "The studies mentioned above inform HCI of the need for exploring religious values, socio-cultural-religious norms, active participation of religious groups with technologies, and their evolved religious practices and lifestyles.

This tension situates itself in Bangladesh through a historical trajectory of 'otherness' -while a part of this is formed by the contemporary manifestation of socio-religiosity, it is also comprised of the history of colonization, modernization, NGO-ization, and industrialization. Thus the message of this paper, in spirit, aligns with the postcolonial computing movement in HCI that critically examines the 'misplaced' and 'displaced' values through design [19,74,128].", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_0": "Now we bring the literature of Urban Modernity, Religion, and Urban Public Space of the Global South to the fore to better understand the embedded complexities of these contexts, where various Western digital interventions are embarking on. While modernity is marked by a set of values, processes, technologies, and the timeperiod when scientifc revolution, industrialization, and capitalism rapidly expanded across the West [128], Urban modernity is characterized by the adoption of modernist ideology in the urban built environment and as a tool to respond to emerging social and political tensions [1]. Predominantly concentrated on urban development strategies and planning policies engendered in the west, urban modernity is globally understood as a product of secular institutions, practices, and discourses [58]. A signifcant portion of knowledge in the urban studies developed in the 19th and 20th century read the cities through scientifc rationalities and measures a city's performativity through the standards of \"industrialized progress. \" [89,91,134] With the theorization of the Global City in the 1980s, this new paradigm of modern urbanism started to expand beyond the West and infuence the spatial, political, and economic readings of modern cities worldwide [116]. These scholarly and design practices reinforced the qualities of western modernity as the standards of a successful, global, modern city [58]. In the late twentieth and early twenty-frst centuries, scholars like David Harvey [62], Edward Soja [124], Saskia Sassen [116], et al. mapped the urban spatial responses around global fows of capital, technology, information and pointed toward the failures of such modernist advancement at diferent scales in an urban setting. Soja [124], Jane Jacobs [78], Fainstein [52], Sandercock [115], and many others shed light on diferent forms of social inequalities and injustices that were introduced by modern cities. Although it was not at the center of their criticism, the western concept of modernity has also always upheld the idea of secularization, and there has been a predominant secular spirit among the modernist planners or scholars toward understanding a city [31,58].", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_metadata": "Authors: Nusrat Jahan Mim | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_metadata": "Authors: J.

Various scholarly works conducted in South Asian and African cities demonstrate several forms of complex yet inevitable engagements among urban religion, spaces, and functions. For instance, AbdouMaliq Simone has examined how the traditional Islamic institution \"zawiyyah\" helps urban Africans to act efectively within a larger globalized economic domain [123]. Zawiyyah provides space and a trans-local network through which marginalized urban entrepreneurs or businessmen can connect, react to, or resist the globalized urban world. Through examples of urban violence, such as the Godhra Station incident and riot in Ahmedabad in 2002, Yasmeen Arif has reported how rehabilitative religious activities take control over urban space, when 'secular' or state-sponsored eforts fail [28]. Similarly, through her ethnographic work, Ara Wilson has demonstrated how multiple vernacular economic systems sustain in Bangkok's global economic setting as the religious shrines invade and disrupt the mobilities of capital and labor [133]. Parthasarathy has taken this further by exploring the spatial politicization of religion in urban Mumbai during the religious festival Chhat Puja [108]. With similar spirit around religious festivals, Mehrotra et al. explain how, during Kumbh Mela, a kinetic city emerges in India and challenges the very necessity of permanency in defning the urban [96]. Taken together, this line of work clearly shows the urgency of studying spatial manifestations of urban religion since religion cannot be seen as peripheral or even antithetical to the urban modernities and civic futures of cities in the global south, which is gradually embracing various digital interventions.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

We address a new application of attention, and introduce a significantly different attention mechanism, which allows each variable to focus on multiple objects. We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. We explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence, where the evidence for each candidate is based on a small set of strong relations, rather than relations to all other entities in the document. The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB. Our proposed sys-tem outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the CoNLL 2003, TAC KBP 2010, 2011 and 2012 tasks.", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_metadata": "Authors: Antoine Bosselut, Hannah Rashkin, Maarten Sap, Chaitanya Malaviya, Asli Celikyilmaz, Yejin Choi | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_2": "Our system uses mention and context models similar to those of Lazic et al.

In particular, we achieve a 20% relative reduction in error from Chisholm and Hachey (2015) on CoNLL, and a 22% error reduction from Cucerzan (2012) on TAC 2012.

We propose a novel way to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. Our model uses two softmax layers in order to predict the next word in conditional language models: one predicts the location of a word in the source sentence, and the other predicts a word in the shortlist vocabulary. At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_4": "Attention is in general used to attend on the most important part of texts, and has been successfully applied in machine translation (Luong et al.), question answering (Xiong et al., 2016) and parsing (Dozat and Manning, 2016), and is adopted in our model for attending on important sentences as evidence. Our work is also related to coherence modeling. Different from traditional coherence studies focusing on discourse coherence among sentences that are widely applied in text generation (Park and Kim, 2015; Kiddon et al., 2016) and summarization (Logeswaran et al., 2018), we try to capture evidential sentences topically coherent not only among themselves but also with respect to the target claim.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

However, most existing related models can only deal with the document data of specific language(s) (typically English) included in the pre-training collection, which is extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

In our framework, the text and layout information are first decoupled and jointoptimized during pre-training, and then re-coupled for fine-tuning. To ensure that the two modalities have sufficient language-independent interaction, we further propose a novel bi-directional attention complementation mechanism (BiACM) to enhance the cross-modality cooperation. Moreover, we present the key point location (KPL) and crossmodal alignment identification (CAI) tasks, which are combined with the widely-used masked visual-language modeling (MVLM) to serve as our pretraining objectives. During fine-tuning, the layout flow (LiLT) can be separated and combined with the off-the-shelf pre-trained textual models (such as RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), InfoXLM (Chi et al., 2021), etc) to deal with the downstream tasks. In this way, our method decouples and learns the layout knowledge from the monolingual structured documents before generalizing it to the multilingual ones.", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

Among them, Bezel Swipe [17] stands out. It is a touch gesture that starts by crossing a bezel. In contrast, a B2B-Swipe is a double-crossing touch gesture, which starts by crossing a bezel and ends by crossing a bezel. Doublecrossing touch gestures are not new; Kurosawa et al. [10] proposed Bezel Check, which starts by crossing a bezel and ends by crossing the same bezel, as a touch gesture to store data in a clipboard placed at the bezel where the gesture was performed. Bezel Check crosses the same bezel of tablets twice. In contrast, B2B-Swipe utilizes the short distances among the four bezels of smartwatches. Bezel Menus [8] explored different bezel-initiated marking menu layouts for eyes-free interaction on small mobile devices. The menus are initiated with Bezel Swipe; thus, B2B-Swipe could co-exist with Bezel Menus.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

Among them, the most similar to B2B-Swipe were developed by G\u00e1bor and Fiener [4], who proposed an input method using a bezel as a tactile landmark for interaction that allows the user to perform eyes-free input. Similarly, B2B-Swipe uses the bezels of a rectangular smartwatch as tactile landmarks so that the user can specify the start bezel without looking at the smartwatch. Some work has used sensors other than the touch screen to realize eyes-free input methods. For example, WatchIt [16] embedded touch sensors within a watchband and allowed the user to perform swiping and tapping on the band; Pasquero et al. [15] used Hall-effect sensors and a force sensor that enable the user to perform various eyes-free gestures, including covering the watch's face and turning the watch's bezel.

Participatory Design (PD) approaches offer one way in which teachers can be directly involved in the design of classroom technologies, however PD processes alone fail to address the challenges of integrating technology within existing practices. In this paper we propose co-teaching as a novel form of co-design practice. We describe a two year longitudinal Co-Teaching project resulting in the development and use of three digital designs for the classroom. Using the TPACK model to guide our reflections we offer insights into the ways that co-teaching can support the design and integration of educational technologies. We suggest that co-teaching as a form of co-design practice offers a way to move teachers from passive adopters of technology to active participants in the design and integration of educational technologies.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_metadata": "Authors: Motohiro Makiguchi, Daisuke Sakamoto, H.

Co-teaching, through its embedded and situated approach to design and evaluation, offers the potential to reduce some of the known tensions within co-design practices in the classroom. It offers a method of design practice specifically for use in the educational technology field and as such is a suitable method to consider the unique challenges of designing technology for the classroom. Alongside ensuring teachers remain active in the design process, we suggest it also offers a potential way of supporting the development of teachers' (and arguably designers') TPACK, something known to support integration of educational technology in the classroom [30]. Co-design as a design practice specifically encourages collaboration between stakeholders with a particular emphasis on the sharing of relevant expertise. The user is positioned as an expert of their experience while the researcher or designer offers tools for ideation as well as technological knowledge [83]. Co-teaching, meanwhile is traditionally a term used to define the practice of two teachers working collaboratively to teach a class and is often used as a method of teacher training e.g. [37,77]. It facilitates the creation of student-centered environments as well as supporting successful school improvement programs through its focus on collaborative reflection and action [61]. Roth & Tobin suggest that co-teaching as a practice offers the opportunity for 'co-generative dialogue', a term to define the collaborative reflection on praxis Teaching Implementing the design in the context.

Where co-design with teachers is reported in HCI, this has been used in a number of contexts such as in the creation of a layered story-telling approach to analytics [55], in exploring wearables for classroom orchestration [74], the co-design of computing curricula at K-12 [98], as well as for the creation of immersive experiences for collective inquiry [53]. While these papers all report on studies that resulted in artefacts that were successfully aligned with classroom practices as a result of co-design processes, the papers themselves primarily focus on the evaluation of these artefacts within their given context. As such, there is less of a focus on specific insights into ways researchers can support the teacher to take ownership of these technologies and integrate them into their practices.", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

Roschelle et al. suggest that key considerations for co-designing with teachers include creating a \"concrete, tangible innovation challenge\", investigating \"current practice and classroom contexts\", and involving \"central accountability for the quality of the products of the co-design\" [80]. One area where co-design with teachers is becoming more prevalent and methods are often discussed explicitly is in the learning analytics field, specifically with a renewed interest in the application of human-centered design approaches to the design of learning analytics tools, e.g., [2,35,58,99].", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_9": "Co-design as an approach is one that could support educational technology integration as research suggests that encouraging teachers to gain design thinking skills might support them to harness educational technology in the classroom.

Approaches in HCI such as design research that focus on the active involvement of the user in the design of systems offer ways to engage teachers in the design of educational technologies that better align with their practices and beliefs. Participatory, and co-design, approaches specifically ensure teachers are involved [80] and have been shown to have substantial effects on the adoption of tools designed [20] as well as encouraging curriculum innovation and technology implementation [70]. There are, however, relatively few instances in HCI literature of teachers participating in co-design processes, with literature more often reporting engagement with students or parents [51]. Studies that do use co-design methodologies with teachers, often primarily consider their involvement in the early stages of the research to gather ideas through workshops and other ideation activities rather than throughout the process, e.g., [51,99], or more commonly report on evaluations of the artefact created rather than the process, e.g., [3,53,55,74,98]. As a result, case studies often do not offer detailed insights into ways researchers can support the teacher to take ownership of these technologies and integrate them into their practices.", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

Firstly, teachers' espoused and enacted pedagogical practices often differ due to the impact of policy and the context [22,54] and secondly, disciplines are known to have unique, or 'signature', pedagogies [90], and therefore the way pedagogical knowledge intersects with technological and content knowledge differs depending on the subject [5]. Utilizing co-teaching as a method in this project allowed the researcher to understand the impact of context on teachers' enacted practices and how these differed from the ones described at the beginning of the design process. This was similarly the case in offering the researcher the ability to gain a situated and contextual understanding of discipline specific pedagogies.", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

However, due to the stigma surrounding self-harm, understanding and intervening in this issue is a challenge. Developing an enhanced understanding of the causes of self-harm during adolescence is of paramount importance, as too is the need to develop effective interventions which are appropriate to adolescents. Current research in supporting young people with self-harm experiences is mainly focused on creating self-help tools (e.g. web-based and mobile apps) based on a wide range of evidenced-based therapy approaches (e.g. cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)). For example the BlueIce app, offers a variety of functionalities including strategies based on CBT and DBT, mood diary, mindfulness exercises, and mood-lifting activities [27]. While there are advancements in the field of smartphone-based sensing in a range of mental health categories (e.g. [67,69], the self-harm space remains relatively disconnected. In a systematic review of digital interventions for self-harm, there was a clear gap for mobile sensing solutions [73]. The majority of studies focused on offering evidenced-based therapies (e.g. acceptance-based therapy [65]. In the same review, only one study designed a game-like app called Therapeutic Evaluative Conditioning (TEC) to increase aversion to self-harm [25]. The results from 1 month trial of TEC showed reduction in self-cutting episodes by almost 40%.", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_abstract": "Self-harm is a prevalent issue amongst young people, yet it is thought around 40% will never seek professional help due to stigma surrounding it. It is generally a way of coping with emotional distress and can have a range of triggers which are highly heterogeneous to the individual. In a move towards enhancing the accessibility of personalized interventions for self-harm, we undertook a three-stage study. We first conducted interviews with 4 counsellors in self-harm to understand how they clinically respond to self-harm triggers. We then ran a survey with 37 young people, to explore perceptions of mobile sensing, and current and future uses for smartphone-based interventions. Finally, we ran a workshop with 11 young people to further explore how a context-aware self-management application might be used to support them.

In workshops, young people expressed that they would be generally be comfortable with the idea of behavioural tracking through smartphonebased sensing, and would give access to their relevant personal data for this purpose. Survey respondents also expressed a similar level of comfort with giving access to their data i.e. phone usage time, location, and the type of health website and apps they access. Young people wanted the self-tracking through apps to be as automated as possible; they preferred a passive relationship with the app preferably tracking their behaviours in the background. This echoes findings by [1] who developed a smartphone-based sensing to automatically detect social rhythms in bipolar disorder to address the challenges associated with manual tracking [37].", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_2": "This study contributes to HCI by advancing our understanding and explicating some nuances of self-initiated individual smartphone use in co-present interactions.

Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75].

EMA research has shown that self-harm engagement is preceded by an increase in negative emotions and followed by a decrease in these same emotions (e.g., [3,6]), lending empirical support to theories that conceptualise self-harm as a form of emotional regulation [43] through a physical 'release' of pain. Importantly, this research has shown that the increase in negative emotions preceding self-harm engagement takes place hours before [3,6], suggesting there may be a critical window wherein preventative measures may be employed.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_11": "There is growing concern that smartphone use negatively afects the quality of co-present interactions [13,20,34,86].

Many psychological predictors of phubbing were previously identifed, such as Internet and smartphone addictions, fear of missing out, and lack of self-control [4,12,16]. This study adds to this line of research by revealing situational and interactional factors that can act as predictors of self-initiated smartphone use. Participants often initiate smartphone use after some signs of disengagement are already visible, for example, the absence of talk and/or lack of mutual gaze orientation. Smartphone use can also be initiated as a \"now-relevant\" or a \"now-or-never\" activity, or specifcally with the purpose of suspending/abandoning ongoing interaction in order to avoid conficts or awkward moments. While audible notifcations and phone calls can have a disruptive efect on co-present interactions due to their unpredictability [85], in the current data set, participants rarely attended to a summons at the moment of its occurrence. Individual smartphone-based activities were usually delayed until an appropriate sequential slot presented itself.

Consequently, researchers have raised concerns about the negative efects of pervasive smartphone use on the quality of face-to-face interactions [2,20,80], hence the term phubbing (phone snubbing), which refers to situations when co-present others are overshadowed by smartphone use. So far, most of the existing studies on smartphone use have been based on surveys, interviews, or data collected in experimental settings. One problem with these approaches is that they often fail to take the interactional context of smartphone use into account. The generalizability of much-published research on this issue is also problematic, as the mainstream approaches do not consider when, how, and by whom smartphone use is initiated (i.e., its communicational motivation) and how co-present others then react to this. The necessity to analyze smartphone use in real-life contexts has been recently emphasized [15,37], but relatively few studies have focused on smartphone use in natural communication settings [21,53,71].", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_13": "Breaks.

This phenomenon was previously interpreted as a response to a discontented action [12], as part of face-saving work [58], or as a way of establishing symmetry in interaction [39]. Although we do not reject these earlier fndings, we do demonstrate one more possible explanation for reciprocal smartphone use. In fact, the reasons and contexts for reciprocated smartphone use can be quite similar to those of initial self-initiated smartphone use (e.g., disengagement). During dyadic interactions, for instance, if the other person is using their smartphone and displays disengagement, the device can serve as a time-passing tool (Example 3). \"Smartphone breaks, \" that is, situations in which all co-present participants are temporarily engaged in their own smartphone-based activities, also emerge in the context of prior mutual disengagement (Example 4).", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_16": "Making the type and phase of smartphone-based activities more accountable for co-present others is one of the solutions that can help young adults to manage their and others' smartphone use.

The current study supports these previous fndings and design solutions by showing some of the ways in which co-present others return smartphone users back into interactions, for example, by commenting on the on-screen activity or by enquiring the smartphone user about the type of activity.

Individuals described how the internet reinforced their self-harm behaviours by embedding them in a community of peers for whom self-harm was as much a part of the daily routine as making a cup of tea, how digital communities allowed for sharing of previously unfamiliar techniques for self-harm, and how online shopping provided mechanisms to anonymously circumvent age-restrictions on razors and other blades. Interviewees highlighted the importance of online visual media in triggering an immediate desire to self harm, and its role in encouraging more extreme self-harm behaviours. Carey et al. [15] conducted surveys and interviews with twenty-nine young people as they engaged with emergency healthcare for issues suicidal-or other self-harmful-behaviour. Whilst some participants reported that they posted to social media because of its anonymity and presence of like-minded individuals, others reported the presence of family members and peers as a motivation for avoiding posting personal content on the platforms -some participants explicitly referred to the creation of additional social media profiles to avoid this issue. Arendt et al. conducted a two-wave panel survey demonstrating that exposure to self-harm content on Instagram was associated with self-harm and negative emotional well-being, and also predicted self-harm and suicide-related outcomes one month later [5].

The organization of individual smartphone use has received much less attention and has been addressed primarily in the context of transport situations [8,49]. The present study looks to fll this gap by exploring how this type of smartphone use is initiated, carried out, and terminated by participants in face-to-face encounters. Considering the increasing prevalence of smartphones in everyday interactions, it is important to understand how they are used in natural contexts. Therefore, the present study is based on the analysis of video-recorded naturally occurring interactions among young adults in cafes and restaurants.

While previous studies argue that young adults need guidance to control smartphone use and phubbing [16], the current study demonstrates that participants in interactions are capable of managing smartphone use and its possible negative efects on the interaction. Generally, smartphone users return to the ongoing conversation themselves, while co-present others continue talking without problematizing their smartphone use (Example 1). Smartphone users can also be brought back to the ongoing interaction by co-present other(s), who can, for example, introduce a new topic or ask the smartphone user about the type of on-screen activity. However, they rarely problematize one's smartphone use and usually do it in a humorous way, as shown in previous studies [39] and confrmed in this study (Example 2). One important fnding that video-based analysis of phubbing reveals is that smartphone use per se is rarely problematized or oriented to as problematic by participants themselves. However, depending on the interactional context and the type of the user's on-screen activity, smartphone users' disengagement can be problematized with reference to smartphone use. Smartphone breaks can be dissolved diferently based on the interactional context that preceded them. If there is a person who is expected to talk prior to the emergence of a \"smartphone break, \" they are usually held responsible for resuming joint interaction (Example 3). However, if \"smartphone breaks\" follow disengagement, smartphone users are left with no ongoing interaction to which they can return (Example 4). In these cases, smartphones are often used as resources for introducing new topics or activities and, therefore, for restoring a common interactional space.", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_15": "There is growing interest in the design of mobile technologies that can encourage users to engage in face-to-face interactions [43] and enhance social interactions [23,72].

Selfharm behaviours include cutting, burning, scratching, and selfhitting [71], and can vary in terms of function, severity and trajectory [11]; many individuals report using several of these methods to injure themselves [24]. Thoughts related to selfharm are defined as a serious desire to engage in self-injury, usually happening when the person is alone and experiencing negative thoughts that last for 1-30 min; with occurrence of up to 5 times per week [46]. Though, by definition, self-harm occurs without suicidal intent, suicidal behaviour and self-harm can coexist [45] and acts of self-harm are a strong risk factor for subsequent suicide attempts [62,72]. Young people who engage in self-harm do so for a multitude of reasons, both intrapersonal (e.g., low self-esteem, impulsivity, poor coping skills) and interpersonal (e.g., bullying, breakdown of a relationship, childhood trauma) [19,58]. According to the Experiential Avoidance Model (EAM), people engage in self-harm as an attempt to regulate and reduce overwhelming emotional states [17]. These unwanted emotional states can be triggered by stressful life events that the person perceives as particularly overwhelming and difficult to handle [44]. They can also be caused by underlying psychological difficulties, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties, and life stressors. Correlational and longitudinal research has identified multiple risk factors for engagement in self-harm including depression and anxiety, low self-esteem, childhood trauma, alexithymia (i.e., difficulty in identifying and describing own emotional states) , impulsivity, and attention and conduct difficulties [14,19,57].", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_metadata": "Authors: M.

Pater et al. [50] noted the presence of selfharm related images in their study of eating disorder content on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. Miguel et al. [40] conducted a manual review of items tagged with #cutting and posted to Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram platforms over a period of six months. They found a high prevalence of graphic posts (i.e., cuts/scars 51%, blood 17%, or injury paraphernalia 22%; total 60%) and negative self-evaluations (46%), particularly on Instagram. References to other mental health conditions were also very common (e.g., depression 78%, eating disorder 43%). A significant minority of posts were used for more positive purposes, actively discouraging self-harm (10%) and providing or signposting recovery resources (5%).", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

Pater et al. [50] identified nineteen hashtags related to self-injury in their analysis of eating disorder content on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. These 19 tags have significant overlap with tags co-occurring (on Instagram) with #depression in an analysis by Andalibi, Ozturk & Forte [2]. One heavily-used tag from both datasets, #selfharmmm, was used by Moreno et al.'s [41] to establish a 'parlance' of self-harm that incorporated a set of otherwise ambiguous terms. Using Instagram to identify an initial set of tags that were often used alongside #selfharmmm, Moreno et al. resolved ambiguous tags by studying their use on other social media platforms and Google Images. In so-doing, they were able to triangulate and identify a set of relevant tags that might otherwise have been considered innocuous (e.g. #blithe); of the eighteen tags determined to be self-harm related, only six triggered Instagram's in-built content advisory redirect service. Similar efforts to build a corpus of terms used in social media hashtags for (German) self-harm related content have also been made by Brown et al. [13].", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_metadata": "Authors: Sebastian Deterding | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science, Psychology | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_8": "The validity of interaction analysis research is mostly achieved through the transparency of research claims [73].

For this study, a detailed examination of participants' verbal and bodily conduct (gaze, body positions, device manipulation, etc.) was carried out to understand how participants initiate smartphone use, how co-present others orient to it, and how the character of this individual activity is collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants.

However, the latter study also noted the presence of content that did not directly depict self-harm (58%) such as selfies and snippets from popular media -these indirect images were more likely to carry recovery-related messages and to be reblogged by other users [56]. Attempts to automate detection of self-harm content have also emerged; Wang et al. used machine learning to automatically identify self-harm related content on Flickr, finding clear patterns in language (tags, captions), social responses (likes, comments) and time of posting for self-harm content when compared to a control image pool [70]. Similar temporal and social patterns have also been seen in manual analyses [13], with content depicting severe wounds generating more comments than moderate and mild injuries.

Moreover, as past research suggests, phone use is socially contagious [22]. Phubbing can be reciprocated by copresent others as a response to a discontented action [12], as a way to save face [58], or as a way to re-establish a certain symmetry [39]. Multimodal interaction analysis can provide additional insights into reciprocal phubbing. In this subsection, we demonstrate that the reasons for reciprocating phubbing are often very similar to the reasons for initiating smartphone use in general. Participants often initiate their individual smartphone-based activities when the joint activity is fnished or suspended (because of one's smartphone use or other activity not related to technology use) or when there are no engaged participants left.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_metadata": "Authors: Byungjoo Lee, Antti Oulasvirta | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_metadata": "Authors: Tingting Liu, Xiaotong Li, Chen Bao, M.

The second part of the defnition is \"ignoring co-present others.\" Although most studies on phubbing mention this aspect [11], a vast majority of them fail to defne what \"ignoring\" means. Other studies defne phubbing even broader: as the action of using a smartphone [87] or looking at it [4] during interactions with others. The focus of these studies is often on the frequency of glancing at or using smartphones, and \"ignoring co-present participants\" is presupposed. However, it has also been shown that smartphone use can be initiated and carried out as a parallel side activity [19], as a resource for co-present interaction [10,30,74,77], or in the context of a joint smartphone-based activity [9,38,75]. As a general principle, it is crucial to distinguish between convergent and divergent smartphone use [8]. Therefore, studying the role of smartphones in face-to-face interactions goes beyond observing how much and how frequently they are used by others. In order to understand smartphone use, it is necessary to consider its interactional context.", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_metadata": "Authors: S. Feger, S.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model. As expected, performance is lower on the Live Chat Customer Service corpus.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_abstract": "This paper addresses the automatic recognition of telicity, an aspectual notion. A telic event includes a natural endpoint (\u201cshe walked home\u201d), while an atelic event does not (\u201cshe walked around\u201d). Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

Limitations of ecological validity, scalability, and generalizability of findings pose a significant challenge for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which ultimately need to function in any context, on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce MYND: An open-source framework that couples consumer-grade recording hardware with an easy-to-use application for the unsupervised evaluation of BCI control strategies. Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording, and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires at home. As a use case, thirty subjects evaluated two BCI control strategies \"Positive memories\" and \"Music imagery\" by using a four-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) with MYND. Neural activity in both control strategies could be decoded with an average offline accuracy of 68.5% and 64.0% across all days.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_3": "Choice of laboratory-based BCI control strategies. We utilized a set of stimulus-free two-task BCI control strategies that were previously evaluated in laboratory experiments with healthy subjects. The control strategies have shown to be immediately executable by subjects without the need for prior training, and they are unrelated to motor processes, which limits accidental movement artifacts. Most importantly, they induce modulation of neural activity in broad areas of the cortex, which could make them particularly suitable for use with consumer-grade EEG equipment with few sensors. We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4]. Now, we complement the laboratory results with MYND to investigate whether these strategies can be executed in an uncontrolled, realistic environment, by utilizing a consumer-grade EEG, and if repeated execution affects performance.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_7": "Control strategy evaluation. With this study, we aim to evaluate how well the BCI control strategies can be performed in an uncontrolled, realistic setting and consumer-grade hardware, outside of the laboratory. The small amount of trials scheduled per day (18 to 36), recorded with a consumer-grade EEG, makes it challenging to learn a good decoding model per subject, day, and strategy. To solve this problem, we leveraged the information obtained from previous laboratory trials with a transfer-learning approach ( [39], toolbox available online 6 , additional details in [11]).

The Dreem EEG 3 , a headset that is specifically designed to be worn at night, offers an application that analyses and classifies sleep patterns through an online service. Headsets by Emotiv 4 feature between five and fourteen channels and are bundled with software subscriptions for private or business use. These devices are designed for self-administration and longer recording sessions. Through custom software, several of them have been used in laboratory studies: In [21] the Muse EEG was successfully used for a spelling system, noting its ease-of-use and sufficient data quality for a BCI application. Emotiv headsets have been used in several BCI studies as well [22], [23]. The Dreem EEG and its bundled proprietary sleep classification platform are promoted as a research tool for sleep studies by the developer [24].

Smart speakers, smartwatches, or websites are treated as conversational interfaces when we can say what we want these technologies to do, rather than by, for instance, clicking on a button. As such, by augmenting existing technologies' capabilities [30], today's CUIs help us with simple tasks, such as online shopping and daily weather reports. CUIs have also been found to beneft accessibility to such online content and services for visually impaired people [1], as well as for elderly people with limited technological skills [62]. Nevertheless, CUIs usually cannot handle more complex interactions [43], and many people expect CUIs only to have utilitarian request-response interactions with us [15] like customer service agents [53]. Although task-oriented CUIs are commonplace now, there is a longer history of conversational agents in HCI. From Weizenbaum's Eliza (1966 [83]) to Amazon Alexa (2014 [29]), conversational agents are not new, though they have lately been making a \"come back\" [19]. In dyadic conversations, CUIs that talk are known to be treated in human-like ways as they trigger our strong social wiring, and they are often seen as friendly or personable agents, which in turn afects our behavior towards them [78,83]. Hence, CUIs are treated in a similar way to humans in some cases, e.g., returning a \"hello\" from a computer as we would with other people [51], but in other cases the fact that they are machines is emphasized, sometimes in unexpected ways. For instance, CUIs are seen as non-judgmental compared to humans [27], allowing some people to open up more with sensitive information [42].", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_para_10": "Any technology's development can enable some while disabling others.

Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants.

However, achieving true behavioral change is difcult for most adults: most of the employed technology and algorithms reinforce current habits and mimic the behavior of others [25,71]. Hence, it is argued that we need a new breed of virtues that can be potentially developed through technology [79]. To achieve this, our impact on the environment should be made more tangible for us to want to develop virtuous actions we have not considered before.

Our work differs from this line of work in three key aspects: (1) Input: SUPPLE and its descendants require functional specifications as input. This is beneficial for application developers as they only need to specify what functions are exposed to users. On the contrary, our work targets UI designers who already have some ideas about desired layouts. It enables designers to define the design task by demonstration, including element types, and preferences regarding size and placement. (2) Layouting: When rendering an interface layout, SUPPLE used three heuristics to sequentially decide the layout -bottom-up, top-down, and minimum remaining values [22]. The key objective was to find a layout that satisfies user preferences, abilities, and device constraints. In contrast, our MILP formulation aims at constructing well-formed grid layouts, with desirable aesthetics, by considering the entire composition of the canvas.

On the other hand, we found a high variation of daily accuracies within subjects. The consumer-grade EEG and our fitting algorithm allowed subjects to record neural data quickly, but the hardware may also pose new challenges for the BCI user: Even when perfectly fitted, the dry sensors at distant ends of the scalp may require users to induce strong, consistent modulations in neural activity in order to be reliably detected. As one potential mediator, meditation experience may affect the ability to maintain focus in unsupervised environments [27]. However, in a post-hoc analysis, we found that self-reported meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies in this study. On the other hand, daily motivational scores correlate positively with accuracy in this study. Therefore, using the MYND platform to combine easily accessible control strategies with motivating, daily feedback could further improve performance and help with more consistent execution. This feedback will need to be robust to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and higher susceptibility to involuntary head-muscle artifacts around the ears and the forehead, where the sensors are located. As one promising approach to implement robust feedback, concurrent work in [28] explored an adaptive signal-filtering method that relies on signal-variation, similar to the fitting algorithm presented here. Providing immediately accessible daily decoding scores could be implemented on the device by utilizing prior information from higher quality laboratory data via transfer-learning, as shown in this offline analysis.", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_1": "Regarding the overall satisfaction with the platform, 25 subjects participated in a post-experiment online survey. On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled. With respect to the two potential mediators meditation experience and daily self-reported motivation, we found that meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies (M = 1.

Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

The first emphasises the issues that arise from implementations which are disconnected from the social, cultural, and physical attributes that are unique to the African context. The second suggests HCI methods that incorporate indigenous concepts in order to make research outputs relevant to end users [57]. In this regard, HCI has been examined through the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu and its philosophical underpinnings have been used as a structural basis which grants situated orientation [58] and provides a relevant framework for design innovation, technology use, its adoption, and how it can drive business innovation in Africa. In recent years, HCI has gained traction in Africa with a strong emphasis on opportunities availed by mobile technologies and increased access to internet and affordability of devices. This has led to great emphasis on design and deployment of usercentered digital solutions that are enmeshed with the needs of an African audience to solve African problems. Building on this work, this paper thus situates itself not in a development discourse -where the researcher designs from an assumption that the non-western community is in need of development and would unquestionably benefit from western technologies [8] -but instead from an afro-centric discourse where knowledge and innovation from the continent is legitimate and equal to others, and can spark innovation and problem-solving in similar contexts on and off the continent.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_8": "While a significant amount of collaborative practice around design in HCI orientates itself towards enabling conditions where participants can be open-minded [15], withhold judgement [56] and imagine radically different futures [14], in many respects the opposite issue is the matter of concern here. The challenge was to shape requesters\u00d5 ideas in ways to fit their imaginations to the capabilities of simple bots. It is often claimed that digital technologies can be \u00d2black boxes\u00d3 that are \u00d4impermeable, inflexible, and unviewable\u00d5 [37]. Indeed, consumer products are critiqued for creating conditions where these hidden innards disable people from appropriating, re-making and engaging in their own practices of design [53]. Therefore, we might take inspiration from attempts to support DIY practices around maker technologies and kits for experimentation with input and output platforms [53]. Simple tools that provide exemplar functions and types of data that act as bot \u00d2building blocks\u00d3 might offer a starting point for guided experimentation. One way of doing so might be to present already existing and typical designs that require completing (as suggested by [44]) through adding or taking away component blocks that represent specific functionality. In doing so, we might more carefully scaffold learning through safe experimentation, and also extend the current positive examples we saw where exemplar bots would be used as a starting point to inspire or ideate a new bot creation by more novice users.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_para_0": "Ultrasound can be generated using low cost components: transducers can be found for as little as $0.25/pc [1], making ultrasound popular in many sensor-driven systems in the Human-Computer Interaction literature. For example, ultrasound is used as a rangefinder [16,4] and for Doppler sensing [13,32]. Beyond these two more common uses of ultrasound, interference effects [9] and beamforming [8] have been utilized for face and hand gesture recognition. Finally, the closest implementation of ultrasound to Digital Ventriloquism is for in-air haptics, which uses a similar array of coplanar transducers working in concert to create focused ultrasonic energy [3,12,19,41]. See [32] for a survey of uses of ultrasound in HCI.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_15": "There is growing interest in the design of mobile technologies that can encourage users to engage in face-to-face interactions [43] and enhance social interactions [23,72]. Previous solutions include designing technologies that ofer meaningful shared experiences [14], create a shared locus of attention [51], or send reminders to technology-abusing users [42]. Studies also showed that smartphone use can be encouraged in situations when it enriches the ongoing activity, for example, taking pictures and videos, sharing memes, and putting on music [51]. As smartphones can both constrain and enable co-present interactions, we should design solutions that would not limit participants' opportunities to use technology as a resource for interaction. In addition, we should consider designing technology that supports participants' own strategies for managing smartphone use and its potential negative efects on co-present interactions.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_13": "Interesting future work directions may look at the applicability of synthesizing data across user populations for mouse input [15,17,33], voice input [21,29], whole-body movement [53,62,63], and even EEG input [25,56]. While all these directions are definitely interesting, they are nevertheless challenging, but worth exploring in order to advance our theoretical and practical knowledge of simulating input data across different user populations toward better interface designs for users will all abilities. Looking forward, we believe that our work already forms a good demonstration of how simulation can be used to refine the gesture design process within HCI and accessibility research and we are eager to see how the community will pick up these ideas and use them for other application areas. CONCLUSION We presented a principled method to generate gesture samples for people with visual impairments using gestures collected from people without visual impairments. Our method is based on the foundations of the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements and its associated Sigma-Lognormal model. The software implementing our method is publicly available at https://g3.prhlt.upv.es, while the gestures dataset can be downloaded from http://www.eed.usv.ro/~vatavu."}}

Over the last decade, IVR platforms for underserved communities seem to have settled on several de facto standards of interface design. These include airtime subsidies, social features, and advertisements to attract and retain users. Prior work shows that lack of airtime subsidy leads to low call volume and engagement [51,62], which causes IVR services to struggle with long-term sustainability [63]. Successful IVR forums have also engaged and retained users through social features (e.g. voting and comments) [49,62], spreading mechanisms such as the ability to forward content to friends [49,50], incentivized referrals [61], and advertisements [41]. Contrary to these prevailing norms, we designed and deployed Karamad without subsidies, social features, spreading mechanisms, or advertisements.

We then implemented sufficient capabilities in Karamad to accommodate all tasks that we intended to deploy. Karamad currently supports Yes-No (binary) questions, multiple choice questions (MCQ), short and long answer questions. Binary questions and multiple choice questions require a single key press as input. Short and long answer questions require free-form 30 and 60 second voice recordings. We did not implement longer speech recordings or multiple digit inputs in Karamad that have been used in the past by IVR-based services [8,41,49,50]. We made Prior work reports that multiple-digit input can be complex for users and suggests incorporating examples to address this issue [8]. We took the approach of restructuring multi-digit input prompts into multiple-choices by segmenting possible answers into ranges. For example, rather than asking for a user's age as multi-digit answer, we reframe the question into a multiple choice question with responses in the form of ranges such as <20, 21-30, 31-40, >40. This approach is less precise, but it is also less complex for users and less expensive overall as including usage examples in the question statement requires more airtime. Similarly, when MCQs exceed 9 choices, we divide into sets of 8 options followed by the \"other\" choice, leading to the next 8 options.", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_metadata": "Authors: Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, D.

Most closely related to this work, neural networks have been combined with weighted finite-state transducers to do morphological reinflection (Rastogi et al., 2016). These prior works learn a single FSA or FST, whereas our model learns a collection of simple but complementary FSAs, together encoding a sequence.

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_4": "ProgVGAT  integrates programs and execution into a natural language inference model.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim.

Previous studies examining sensor integration have focused on collecting behavioral and physiological data in VR-based data-driven interventions. For example, vrSocial's use of visualization of proximity, voice volume, and speech duration of autistic children in real-time within virtual spaces was an effective way for the children to better regulate their proximity in VR [13]. Another VR-based system correlated children's physiological signals with their affective states while participating in given social tasks, which resulted in a VRbased system that was adaptive to participants' performance [48]. With VR, user data such as voice volume or affective state can be collected while they interact in the virtual environments, while stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, professionals, co-workers) can contribute to the learning process [5,[57][58][59].

The various sensing effects, such as distorting the VR screen to simulate dizziness or visualizing fast heartbeats on a VR screen may further help neurotypical employees experience how autistic people might feel differently in specific situations.

Furthermore, the lack of sufficient precedent and theoretical guidance for VR intervention design and the fact that actual users were not sufficiently involved in the design process were pointed out as limitations [30,68]. This critical view emphasized the importance of understanding the characteristics, needs, and preferences of autistic individuals and stakeholders when designing VR experiences for them [68]. Thus, our research aims to improve the understanding of how VR experiences should be designed to enhance social and communication skills by involving autistic people and members of their support networks in the early stages of VR design. Our work seeks to perform the inclusive, participatory design of VR experiences with and for autistic adults who currently face various challenges in the workplace.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_13": "6.2 VR to Promote Self-advocacy and Sense of Agency for Autistic Employees Bolte et al. [9] called for future research to push the importance of rethinking the way autism is perceived, thus emphasizing the use of words that promote respect and an accurate understanding of autistic people. Researchers have re-conceptualized autism as neurodiversity [27,87], contesting the understanding of independent living or the concept of autonomy. A central premise of neurodiversity is to support self-advocacy and personal autonomy in autistic individuals, allowing them to exert more control over their own lives [51]. To achieve autonomy, one must have functional communication, so any intervention promoting neurodiversity should provide opportunities to express agency and-more importantly-build effective and respectful communication between autistic persons and others in their environment [51]. The concept of agency can be used as an effective framework to understand the social interactions between neurodiverse communication facilitators [79].", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_6": "2.2.1 VR to train employment skills. Several researchers have investigated how VR technologies support autistic individuals to acquire employment skills [14,21]. Employment skills can be divided into two broad categories: job-specific skills called hard skills (e.g., folding, photocopying, and sweeping), and more generic employment-related skills called soft skills (e.g., time management, social skills, and interview skills) [98]. Prior technology-related studies focused more on hard skills rather than soft skills [15], even though autistic people often experience more challenges at work due to their soft skills [33]. Social situations that may arise at work (e.g., working with co-workers, managing conflict, dealing with office politics) have been identified as major challenges that autistic people face in the workplace [65]. Although some studies investigate the use of VR to develop autistic people's soft skills, many focus on learning skills for job interviews such as how to properly communicate and respond in interview situations (e.g., emotional regulatory strategies and self-advocacy methods), use non-verbal communication (e.g., eye contact) when interviewing, and manage attire or hygiene when preparing for an interview [41,64,89,93], rather than on skills related to navigating social situations associated with ongoing employment (e.g., having lunch with co-workers and working with customers). While interview skills are important for obtaining employment, more contextualized and practical support for the everyday social encounters of autistic people in workplaces would further advance their work experience, satisfaction, and success.", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_para_2": "VR is an ideal playground for the body ownership illusions (see, e.g., [7,51,55,61]).

Using state-of-the-art VR (with a head-mounted display and accurate hand tracking), two VR scenes where participants experienced the illusory touch were created.

The Weather Channel has also used these tools to communicate disaster risk to the public [56]. AR/VR tools have also been used by HCI research into science education [106]. Such approaches ofer the potential to deliver contextualized risk information to the public in ways that includes familiar local landmarks and settings, which is thought to improve user understanding and trust. Finally, including information about vulnerable communities or public resources is another tactic that may be useful.

This is important, as changes to our field of view affects how much we see, and can influence thinking processes that enhance or hinder creativity [25,34] and affect human performance [14,29]. As such, we invite HCI practitioners to use peripheral awareness as a neurological state to better understand how we can support human performance in other areas within HCI, such as: health and wellbeing, critical systems, sports, and creative and collaborative work, to name just a few. Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance. In this article we explored a new mechanism for integration focusing on \"inside\" the user's body to design an integration system that reacts to changes in the user's peripheral awareness.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_abstract": "Maker culture encourages do-it-yourself practices to create, repair, and repurpose technology.

This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_metadata": "Authors: Xu Han, Michelle X.

SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

Reusable neural network, a topic related to transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), is introduced to accelerate the model training in computer vision. One classical work is Net2Net (Chen et al., 2016), which first proposes the concept of the function-preserving transformation to make neural networks reusable. However, Net2Net randomly selects the neurons to be split. To handle this problem, some works (Wu et al., , 2020bWang et al., 2019b;Wu et al., 2020a) leverage a functional steepest descent idea to decide the optimal subset of neurons to be split. The pruning technique (Han et al., 2015) is also introduced for reusable neural networks (Feng and Panda, 2020). In this paper, we study the reusable pre-trained language model and propose a new method, bert2BERT, to accelerate the pre-training of BERT and GPT.", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_para_4": "Recurrent neural networks.

The most notable variants, the long short-term memory (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and gated recurrent units (GRU; Cho et al., 2014), have become ubiquitous in NLP algorithms (Goldberg, 2016). Recently, several works introduced simpler versions of RNNs, such as recurrent additive networks (Lee et al., 2017) and Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2017).

Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models.

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_metadata": "Authors: Roy Schwartz, Sam Thomson, Noah A.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

We experiment with various adaptations of BERT-based models (Devlin et al., 2019) trained and tested on Oracc, combined with a greedy decoding scheme to extend the prediction from single tokens to multiple words. We specifically focus on the effect multilingual pretraining has on downstream performance, which was recently shown beneficial for low-resource settings (Chau et al., 2020).", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_metadata": "Authors: Jiapeng Wang, Lianwen Jin, Kai Ding | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_metadata": "Authors: Vania Mendoncca, Ricardo Rei, Lu\u00edsa Coheur, Alberto Sardinha, Ana L'ucia Santos INESC-ID Lisboa, Instituto Superior T'ecnico, AI Unbabel, C.

From non-parallel streams of Chinese characters and Chinese pinyin syllables, it establishes a many-to-many mapping between characters and pronunciations. Using unsupervised methods, the program effectively deciphers writing into speech. Its token-level character-to-syllable accuracy is 89%, which significantly exceeds the 22% accuracy of prior work.", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.
