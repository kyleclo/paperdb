However, known methods and physical realizations exhibit considerable usability and customization issues. In this paper, we propose 3D-Auth, a new concept of two-factor authentication. 3D-Auth is based on customizable 3D-printed items that combine two authentication factors in one object. The object bottom contains a uniform grid of conductive dots that are connected to a unique embedded structure inside the item. Based on the interaction with the item, different dots turn into touch-points and form an authentication pattern. This pattern can be recognized by a capacitive touchscreen. Based on an expert design study, we present an interaction space with six categories of possible authentication interactions. In a user study, we demonstrate the feasibility of 3D-Auth items and show that the items are easy to use and the interactions are easy to remember.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work. Some works (Gong et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020;Gu et al., 2021) propose progressive learning to accelerate the pre-training, which are motivated by the fact that different layers have some similar knowledge (e.g., attention patterns). They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) proposes a task of replaced token detection to predict whether each token in the input was replaced or not, which improves the pre-training efficiency. Our method is orthogonal to this kind of work and the combination of ELECTRA and bert2BERT could achieve better efficiency.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_abstract": "We introduce Sentence-level Language Modeling, a new pre-training objective for learning a discourse language representation in a fully self-supervised manner.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

However, conventional pre-training objectives do not explicitly model relational facts in text, which are crucial for textual understanding. To address this issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework ERICA to obtain a deep understanding of the entities and their relations in text. Specifically, we define two novel pre-training tasks to better understand entities and relations: (1) the entity discrimination task to distinguish which tail entity can be inferred by the given head entity and relation; (2) the relation discrimination task to distinguish whether two relations are close or not semantically, which involves complex relational reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ERICA can improve typical PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) on several language understanding tasks, including relation extraction, entity typing and question answering, especially under low-resource settings.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_6": "where M is the number of tokens in the ground truth answer a, a i is the i th token in a, and a 0 is the beginning of sequence token (<s>). We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_7": "After pre-training, all the model parameters are trained end-to-end by minimizing the squared error between the class probability distribution of the prediction and that of the ground truth over the claims.

More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%.

Benefiting from designing various effective self-supervised learning objectives, such as masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2018), PLMs can effectively capture the syntax and semantics in text to generate informative language representations for downstream NLP tasks. However, conventional pre-training objectives do not explicitly model relational facts, which frequently distribute in text and are crucial for understanding the whole text. To address this issue, some recent studies attempt to improve PLMs to better understand relations between entities (Soares et al., Peng et al., 2020). However, they mainly focus on within-sentence relations in isolation, ignoring the understanding of entities, and the interactions among multiple entities at document level, whose relation understanding involves complex reasoning patterns. According to the statistics on a human-annotated corpus sampled from Wikipedia documents by Yao et al. (2019), at least 40.7% relational facts require to be extracted from multiple sentences.

A heuristic-based system was first introduced by Chandrasekar and Srinivas (1997) which induces rules for simplification automatically extracted from annotated corpora. Canning and Tait (1999) proposed a modular system that uses NLP tools such as morphological analyzer, POS tagger 1 https://github.com/subramanyamdvss/UnsupNTS plus heuristics to simplify the text both lexically and syntactically. Most of these systems (Siddharthan, 2014) are separately targeted towards lexical and syntactic simplification and are limited to splitting and/or truncating sentences. For paraphrasing based simplification, data-driven approaches were proposed like phrase-based SMT (Specia, 2010;\u0160tajner et al., 2015) or their variants (Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Xu et al., 2016), that combine heuristic and optimization strategies for better TS. Recently proposed TS systems are based on neural seq2seq architecture (Bahdanau et al., 2014) which is modified for TS specific operations (Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017). While these systems produce state of the art results on the popular Wikipedia dataset (Coster and Kauchak, 2011), they may not be generalizable because of the noise and bias in the dataset (Xu et al., 2015) and overfitting. Towards this,\u0160tajner and Nisioi (2018) showed that improved datasets and minor model changes (such as using reduced vocabulary and enabling copy mechanism) help obtain reasonable performance for both in-domain and cross-domain TS.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_0": "Text Simplification (TS) deals with transforming the original text into simplified variants to increase its readability and understandability. TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_5": "We also compare our approach with existing supervised and unsupervised lexical simplifications like LIGHTLS (Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), Neural Text Simplification or NTS (Nisioi et al., 2017), Syntax based Machine Translation or SBMT (Xu    PBSMT (Wubben et al., 2012).

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_metadata": "Authors: Yice Zhang, Yifan Yang, Yihui Li, Bin Liang, Shiwei Chen, Yixue Dang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_metadata": "Authors: Vania Mendoncca, Ricardo Rei, Lu\u00edsa Coheur, Alberto Sardinha, Ana L'ucia Santos INESC-ID Lisboa, Instituto Superior T'ecnico, AI Unbabel, C.

Early studies normalize informal sentences with rules, before statistical and neural models become a prevailing method in the field. While a rule-based system is still a common preprocessing step for formality style transfer in the neural era, it could introduce noise if we use the rules in a naive way such as data preprocessing. To mitigate this problem, we study how to harness rules into a state-of-the-art neural network that is typically pretrained on massive corpora. We propose three fine-tuning methods in this paper and achieve a new state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_metadata": "Authors: Jiapeng Wang, Lianwen Jin, Kai Ding | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference"}}

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_para_5": "FewRel (Han et al., 2018;Gao et al., 2019) is a common benchmark for few-shot learning in NLP, which consists of many few-shot relation classification tasks created by sub-sampling from a pool of relation labels.

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition"}}

Several scholars in human-computer interaction (HCI) [8], informatics [31], and game studies [58,59,61,63] hypothesize that mainstream forms of gamification -behavior tracking, quantitative progress feedback, and reward systems -might thwart rather than support the openness, inconsequentiality, and voluntariness characteristic for play. And evidence suggests that forced serious game play results in negative affect and reduced performance [19], and that worker consent moderates whether imposed workplace gamification results in positive or negative affect [29].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_metadata": "Authors: James Fiacco, Samridhi Choudhary, C.

It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent pieces of evidence, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidence as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_1": "A recent trend is that researchers are trying to establish more objective tasks and evidence-based verification solutions, which focus on the use of evidence obtained from more reliable sources, e.g., encyclopedia articles, verified news, etc., as an important distinguishing factor (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018). Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_3": "More recently, semantic matching methods were proposed to retrieve evidence from relatively trustworthy sources such as checked news and Wikipedia articles. Popat et al. (2018) attempted to debunk false claims by learning claim representations from relevant articles using an attention mechanism to focus on words that are closely related to the claim. Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules. Similar pipelines were developed by most of the participating teams (Nie et al., 2019;Padia et al., 2018;Alhindi et al., 2018;Hanselowski et al., 2018) in FEVER shared task (Thorne et al., 2018b). Apart from the document retrieval function, our model is end-to-end and aims to learn sentence-level evidence with a hierarchical attention framework.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_3": "Our experiments adopt the popular three-stage pipeline of FEVER task, comprising document selection, evidence sentence extraction, and claim verification (Thorne et al., 2018b). We primarily focus on the claim verification stage of FEVER, while using the state-of-the-art document selec-tion and evidence sentences extraction from Liu et al. (2020). Our focus is motivated since only the claim verification step involves a joint (often complicated) reasoning over the extracted evidence.

Typically, given the claims, models are learned from auxiliary relevant sources such as news articles or social media responses for capturing words and linguistic units that might indicate viewpoint or language style towards the claim Rashkin et al., 2017;Popat et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018). However, the factuality of a claim is independent of people's belief and subjective language use, and human perception is unconsciously prone to misinformation due to the common cognitive biases such as naive realism (Reed et al., 2013) and confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998).", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_5": "Our approach exploits and integrates two core semantic relations: 1) coherence of the sentences given the claim; 2) entailment relation between the claim and each sentence, which are described more specifically below. Coherence Evaluation: According to the coherence theory of truth, the truth of any (true) proposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of propositions (Young, 2018). In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency. Textual Entailment: Entailment is used to measure whether a piece of evidence semantically infers a given claim. We propose an entailmentbased attention component that can be pre-trained to capture entailment relations (Dagan et al., 2010;Bowman et al., 2015) based on sentence pairs labeled with NLI-specific classes: entails, contradicts and neutral. This pre-trained component together with the entire claim verification framework then will be trained end-to-end to attend on the salient sentences for inferring the claim.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_2": "The literature on fact-checking and credibility assessment has been reviewed by several comprehensive surveys (Shu et al., 2017;Zubiaga et al., 2018;Kumar and Shah, 2018;Sharma et al., 2019).

Many studies on claim verification extracted veracity-indicative features that can reflect stances and writing styles from relevant texts such as news articles, microblog posts, etc. and used the traditional supervised models to learn the parameters (Castillo et al., 2011;Qazvinian et al., 2011;Rubin et al., 2016;Ferreira and Vlachos, 2016;Rashkin et al., 2017). Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Ma et al., 2016), convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Wang, 2017) and recursive neural networks (Ma et al., 2018) were also exploited to learn the feature representations.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_abstract": "Fact-verification systems are well explored in the NLP literature with growing attention owing to shared tasks like FEVER.

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1.

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain.

Additionally, most TTS engines accept Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2] as input, allowing for a degree of control over prosodic features such as the rate of speech, the pitch of the voice, and cadence/pacing of words. The fact that these advances have yet to be incorporated into SGDs in a meaningful way is a major issue for AAC. Recent work such as that of Higginbotham [9], Kane et. al. [11], and Pullin et al. [22] has described the importance of this issue and the need to develop better AAC systems capable of more expressive speech, but to date, there are no research or commercially available AAC devices that provide advanced expressive speech capabilities, with a majority only allowing for basic modification of speech parameters (overall rate and volume) that cannot be varied on-the-fly (as utterances are constructed and played), while not leveraging the capabilities available in modern TTS engines.", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_para_1": "While AAC devices are significantly lacking in the ability to generate expressive speech, a large amount of speech synthesis research has aimed at creating more expressive speech engines [24].

Speech engines such as Pitrelli et. al.'s [20] have the ability to render speech that listeners can identify as exhibiting several different tones (e.g., \"conveying bad news\" or \"asking yes-no questions\"). Several commercial engines such as the IBM Watson [28], CereVoice [4], and Nuance Loquendo [18] allow for the rendering of emotional synthesized speech. Each of these systems is similar in allowing developers to select between a small set of emotional categories when rendering speech (e.g., CereVoice supports a default voice in addition to \"happy,\" \"sad,\" \"calm,\" and \"cross\"). Recent developments on the MaryTTS engine (an open-source TTS research platform) [14] have extended beyond simply accepting the specification of emotional categories, allowing for emotional tones to be specified with continuous values for emotional dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance [5]. In addition to allowing for the high-level specification of a tone of voice, each of these TTS engines also supports low-level speech modifications through the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2].

In this work, the authors propose that AAC users should be able to author tones of voice and save and share these tones with other AAC users. The tone authoring process was explored through the ToneTable art piece, which accepts speech audio as input and allows ablebodied users to physically manipulate the tone of that speech [1]. While ToneTable provoked critical thought around the expressivity of speech, it was not a system designed for AAC, or intended to be used by people with speech impairments. Pauletto et. al.

Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing, but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs, we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback. Our field study demonstrated the value of providing better and more extensive writing support on SNSs, and the potential of AI for building a more inclusive Internet.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

This is important, as changes to our field of view affects how much we see, and can influence thinking processes that enhance or hinder creativity [25,34] and affect human performance [14,29]. As such, we invite HCI practitioners to use peripheral awareness as a neurological state to better understand how we can support human performance in other areas within HCI, such as: health and wellbeing, critical systems, sports, and creative and collaborative work, to name just a few. Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance. In this article we explored a new mechanism for integration focusing on \"inside\" the user's body to design an integration system that reacts to changes in the user's peripheral awareness.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_metadata": "Authors: Hyunchul Lim, Jungmin Chung, Changhoon Oh, Sohyun Park, Joonhwan Lee, B.

What appears to be missing in this vibrant design space is systems that draw from the \"inside\" of the user's body to explore inner bodily processes as mechanisms of integration. As a result, we consider changes to the field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a valuable mechanism for integration between the user and the system as it is linked with human performance [32,44,45].", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_5": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use changes in a user's field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a mechanism for integration. We suggest that they should consider how the integration system extends the user's abilities in the contexts of the experience. Using EEG to monitor neural activity can offer access to a user's preattentive processing state, resulting in possibilities for integration where the system responds to a situation \"before\" the user can with their body. This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_abstract": "In this work we introduce peripheral awareness as a neurological state for real-time human-computer integration, where the human is assisted by a computer to interact with the world. Changes to the field of view in peripheral awareness have been linked with quality of human performance. This instinctive narrowing of vision that occurs as a threat is perceived has implications in activities that benefit from the user having a wide field of view, such as cycling to navigate the environment. We present \"Ena\", a novel EEG-eBike system that draws from the user's neural activity to determine when the user is in a state of peripheral awareness to regulate engine support. A study with 20 participants revealed various themes and tactics suggesting that peripheral awareness as a neurological state is viable to align human-machine integration with internal bodily processes. Ena suggests that our work facilitates a safe and enjoyable human-computer integration experience.", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_metadata": "Authors: Nikhila Nyapathy, R.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_metadata": "Authors: James Fiacco, Samridhi Choudhary, C.

Text segmentation (Hearst, 1994;Choi, 2000;Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008;Koshorek et al., 2018) is another well studied discourse analysis task that aims to divide a text into a sequence of topically coherent segments and has been shown useful for text summarization (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), sentiment analysis (Sauper et al., 2010) and dialogue systems (Shi et al., 2019). The news discourse profiling task is complementary to the well-established discourse analysis tasks and is likely to further benefit many NLP applications. First, it studies genre-specific discourse structures, while the aforementioned discourse analysis tasks study genre independent general discourse structures and thus fail to incorporate domain knowledge. Second, it focuses on understanding global content organization structures with the main event at the center, while the existing tasks focus on either understanding rhetorical aspects of discourse structures (RST and PDTB discourse parsing) or detecting shallow topic transition structures (text segmentation).", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

Deliberative discourse requires the giving and receiving of reasons when discussing propositions [20]. In contrast, the rhetoric elements of civic discourse are less constrained by rationalization [12]. Demagogic speech tends to oversimplify complex societal issues [78].

Developing the corresponding set of labels was a cyclical rather than a linear process. After critical engagement with the cited literature on the three political discourse theories, two co-authors separately developed codes based on their analysis of the most essential components of each political discourse theory. Then, they compared the created categories and, with the aid of a third co-author, agreed on an initial set of components. Through multiple rounds of discussion, two co-authors assigned the essential components to each of the three discourse theories. This process led to further discussion on the definitional scope of the components. Thus, through multiple rounds of discussion between three co-authors, going back and forth between the choices of essential components and their assignment to the three discourse theories, we finally agreed on thirteen essential components that could be operationalized in a multilabel classification task (see final set of components together with their definitions in Appendix B & Table 5). We document disagreement among co-authors on the definition and assignment of some of the components in Appendix B (see Fact-related argument in Appendix B.3 and Identity Labels in Appendix B.8).

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_metadata": "Authors: Prafulla Kumar Choubey, A.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_metadata": "Authors: Yice Zhang, Yifan Yang, Yihui Li, Bin Liang, Shiwei Chen, Yixue Dang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_metadata": "Authors: Min-Hsuan Yeh, Lun-Wei Ku | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_metadata": "Authors: Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Zhihao Fan, Zengfeng Huang, Weijian Sun, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_9": "We have adopted the same preprocessing strategy as for the categorization task, with the exception of OHSUMED, for which suitable LTR features are already given.

They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021).

In 1923 Freyd discussed the broader application of the technique in the field of psychology, providing heuristic guidelines for visual appearance [10]. VASs have traditionally been displayed on paper, with their key advantages over other techniques being that they can be self-administered with little training, and provide extremely sensitive (granular) measurement. Their disadvantages have traditionally been that they are visual, cannot be administered aurally, and take longer to encode (measure/transcribe). However, when administered on a computer, the measuring step can be automated, making VASs a viable alternative to discrete Likert scales.

After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

While there exists a vast palette of potential mark shape options for which we would anticipate difering patterns of perceptual judgments [8], we focus on triangles and circles, which are the most widely used marks. For example, over 97% of all single-class scatterplots in the VizNet [13] dataset use one of those two mark types. Besides a default upward oriented orientation, we test triangles rotated using data-driven factors, with circles as a default option without inherent orientation. We also found that most triangle marks in VizNet [13] dataset are equilateral triangles; thus, while isosceles triangles have less ambiguity in their encoding of orientation, we use equilateral triangles.

This is the case if the residual bandwidth is small, outliers are far away from the major cluster or have diferent densities, or if the intermingled clusters have radically diferent slopes. In such cases there is little ambiguity in the trend, and so estimates are accurate even without guidance from mark orientation. Implications for Scatterplot Design. The above fndings suggest that mark orientation can be a visual cue to implicitly encode trend information. A trend line directly encodes the model in a dogmatic way, whereas data-driven marks act as less dogmatic guidance that can be ignored or downweighted when they seem inappropriate or are clearly at odds with the depicted data, functioning as a form of \"implicit uncertainty visualization\" [6]. We have shown viewers will, in their own visual estimates, ignore things like outliers that would be a problem for explicit trend lines based on models of insufcient complexity. Fig. 19 shows how data-driven marks could be used to disambiguate trends in a health care dataset for investigating how the blood pressure is related to sodium excretion [11]. We can see that the slopes of the OLS trend and the robust trend have opposing signs (see Fig. 19(a)). Using data-driven marks can suggest a resolution to this ambiguity for the reviewer by downweight (b) or reinforcing (c) the contribution of the outlying points to the overall trend. Although it is hard to make a fair comparison between such implicit and explicit trend visualizations (for instance, Correll & Heer [7] believed that participants would adhere to explicit trend lines so closely if present that they used such stimuli as action checks), we believe that data-driven orientation can assist in regression by eye, especially for cases where standard models like OLS are inappropriate, or there are multiple valid interpretations of the data (as in Xiong et al.

in this work, we investigate the use of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to improve performance on the ORConvQA task by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure. We propose monoQA, which uses a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader. Our model, which is based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) text generation model, is fine-tuned simultaneously for both reranking (in order to improve the precision of the top retrieved passages) and extracting the answer. Unlike previous work, monoQA makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task, followed by the other tokens for the answer extraction task, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Our contributions are summarised as follows: (1) we leverage Multi-Task Learning with a text generation model by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure to effectively addresses the ORConvQA task; (2) using two different ORConvQA datasets, we compare our model to two strong baselines from the literature, and show that our MTL reranker and generative reader approach yields the best F1, Recall, MRR, Figure 2: An example dialog and relevant passages from the ORConvQA dataset (Qu et al., 2020). and MAP performance improvements over the strongest baseline with statistically significant improvements ranging from +5.70% to +23.34%; (3) the proposed MTL model combining the reranker and generative reader significantly outperforms and is twice as fast for inference than the individual application of the monoT5 and UnifiedQA models for reranking and extracting the answer.", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_2": "Our system uses mention and context models similar to those of Lazic et al.

In this manner, the network structure is shared between the reranker and the reader. Doing this, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021 also typically approach reranking and extractive reading as classification tasks, with two fully-connected layers (one for the reranker and reader, respectively) added to find an answer span for the retrieved passages (start/end positions) as well as to predict the relevance score of the question to the passage as shown in Figure 1(a).

In order to build a traditional modular-based dialog system, researchers first identify the semantic representation, such as the dialog acts and slots in user utterances. Then they accumulate these semantic representations over time to track the dialog state. Finally they apply RL to learn an optimized dialog policy given the dialog state (Raux et al., 2005;Shi and Yu, 2018). Such modular-based dialog systems are effective in narrow task domains, such as searching a bus route schedule and reserving a restaurant through natural language, but they fail to generalize to complex settings where the size of the action space increases. Owing to the development of deep learning, RL on neural sequence-to-sequence models has been explored in more complex dialog domains such as open-domain conversation (Li et al., 2016) and negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017). However, due to the difficulty of assigning appropriate rewards when operating in a large action space, these frameworks cannot generate fluent dialog utterances. Zhao et al. (2019) proposed a novel latent action RL framework to marry the advantage of a module based approach and sequence-to-sequence approach. They learned the optimal dialog policy in a complex task-oriented dialog domain while achieving decent conversation quality. We study the similar issue in a multimodal task-oriented dialog scenario. We propose an iterative approach to optimize dialog policy using RL methods and system response generation via SL.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_16": "Our previous discussion demonstrates some of the conceptual plurality inherent to different political discourse theories.

When explaining a protest or strike, political opportunity theories would focus on the nature of the grievances of movement actors, expecting that those with greater grievances would be more likely to take action [55].

In offering simple solutions that often entail \"pseudo-reasoning\" [57], demagogic statements are difficult to falsify if not even impervious and unresponsive to opposing arguments [101]. Not only does this impede a constructive exchange of propositions but, for the demagogue, it renders perspectivetaking of opposing positions irrelevant. The oversimplification of complex social phenomena results in a polarization that facilitates political mobilization [78]. Demagogic talk aims to contrast social groups, highlighting apparent identity differences and putting them in competition with each other. It promises to care for the needs of \"ordinary\" people, creating an ethos around the often hateful division into laypeople and experts, elites and the forgotten, or poor and rich [101,102]. The disregard for truthfulness and the evocation of a collective identity based on hate, fear-mongering, and scapegoating means that demagogic rhetoric necessarily contains emotional linguistic components [57].

Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship between social media interface design and respectful political discussion among users.1", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_2": "The clearest theorization of attitudes as positions in an argumentative space is due to the discursive psychologist Michael Billig, according to whom culture ofers a set of shared and accepted commonplaces [3] both in favor and against a given controversial behavior [3].

Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy.

Engaging with the literature on demagogic and civic discourse revealed identity labels to be relevant for these two types of discourse but not deliberative discourse (for demagogic discourse, see [57,63,102]; for civic discourse, see [2,24,60]). However, conceptualizing different identity references for demagogic and civic discourse proved to be challenging and authors disagreed on how to define identity labels for demagoguery and civic engagement. Out of all three political discourse theories, civic engagement is the most contested one. It allows for the most diverse definitions of what it's essential components are (e.g., compare [40] and [24]). We first agreed on a basic identity label to identify comments that expressed the existence of collective or group (i.e., collective rhetoric). One author then proposed an identity label to highlight group differences, a feature of both demagogic and civic discourse [35,60,63]. This label was called \"we vs. them\" to underline the competitive nature of interaction in both demagoguery and civic engagement. In demagogic discourse, members often degrade another group to establish a sense of unity. Here, a unity is formed around group characteristics and people that appear to best embody such characteristics. In short, narratives of unity are not formed around a serious discussion around policy-making to bring about political change but around important personas. This, one author pointed out could be a decisive conceptual distinction between identity in demagoguery and civic discourse. To account for the lack of engagement with policy-making topics to establish a sense of unity (as is the case for civic engagement), we finally agreed on two more identity labels for demagogic discourse: \"you in the epicenter\" and \"who instead of what. \" The first label highlights the importance of a group and why it should be treated preferentially while the second appeals to the characteristics of in-group or out-group members. In civic discourse, we added the labels \"empathy/reciprocity, \" \"counterargument\", and \"situational call to action\" that, together with \"we vs. them, \" would sample comments that expressed a sense of unity but that at the same time featured constructive and productive interactions on specific policy-making goals."}}

For example, by completing a drawing that a user has started [36,9,32,14] or filling in a missing section of a song [27,24], generative models could enable untrained lay users to take part in creative experiences that would otherwise be difficult to achieve without additional training or specialization [29,12,19].

In a needfinding study with a widely used, interactive musical AI, we found that the AI can overwhelm users with the amount of musical content it generates, and frustrate them with its non-deterministic output. To better match co-creation needs, we developed AI-steering tools, consisting of Voice Lanes that restrict content generation to particular voices; Example-Based Sliders to control the similarity of generated content to an existing example; Semantic Sliders to nudge music generation in high-level directions (happy/sad, conventional/surprising); and Multiple Alternatives of generated content to audition and choose from. In a summative study (N=21), we discovered the tools not only increased users' trust, control, comprehension, and sense of collaboration with the AI, but also contributed to a greater sense of self-efficacy and ownership of the composition relative to the AI.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_para_3": "As their name implies, generative deep neural networks can synthesize content.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features.

They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

For example, an AI might flesh out a half-sketched drawing [36], write the next paragraph of a story [7], or add an image to a design mood board [33]. Across this range of prior work, a core challenge has been developing collaborative AI agents that can adapt their actions based on the goals and behaviors of the user. To this end, some systems design the AI to generate output conditioned upon the surrounding context of human-generated content [14,7,18], while others leverage user feedback to better align AI behavior to user intents [23,33,9]. Research has also observed that users desire to take initiative in their partnership with AI [36], with controllability and comprehensibility being key challenges to realizing this vision [1]. Building on this need, our work enables users to express their preferences to an AI collaborator through a variety of means.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_metadata": "Authors: \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Sungjin Ahn, Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_para_0": "Question Generation (QG) from text aims to automatically construct questions from textual input (Heilman and Smith, 2010). It receives increasing attentions from research communities recently, due to its broad applications in scenarios of dialogue system and educational reading comprehension (Piwek et al., 2007;. It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text. One possible reason causing the problem is that current sequenceto-sequence models learn a latent representation for the input text without explicitly modeling semantic information included. We therefore argue that modeling facts in the input text can help to alleviate the problem of existing neural QG models.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_metadata": "Authors: Prafulla Kumar Choubey, A.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_6": "We further enhance the sentence representation by capturing the entailment relations between the sentences and the claim based on the NLI method (Bowman et al., 2015) for strengthening the semantic inference capacity of our model.

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We present a novel neural network architecture to simultaneously learn a two-part representation which is based on the principle of segregating source specific representation from the common representation. The first part captures the source specific characteristics while the second part captures the truly common representation. Our architecture optimizes an objective function which acts adversarial for the source specific part if it contributes towards the cross-domain learning.

Yet, extreme gender participation disparities exist in which men significantly outnumber women. A central concern has been that due to self-focus bias, these disparities can lead to corresponding gender content disparities, in which content of interest to men is better represented than content of interest to women. This paper investigates the relationship between participation and content disparities in OpenStreetMap. We replicate findings that women are dramatically under-represented as OSM contributors, and observe that men and women contribute different types of content and do so about different places. However, the character of these differences confound simple narratives about self-focus bias: we find that on a proportional basis, men produced a higher proportion of contributions in feminized spaces compared to women, while women produced a higher proportion of contributions in masculinized spaces compared to men.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_11": "This frst research question seeks to capture diferences in the geographic context of male and female contributions.

We observe this both in terms of the regions where men and women edit (e.g., rural vs. urban) and in terms of the type of content that they contribute (e.g., the specifc spatial entities they add to the database). However, our results also reveal critical complexity in these diferences that belie a simple gender-based self-focus bias interpretation [65,68,92]. In particular, we observed that men disproportionately contribute to entities that critical geographers [65,92] have identifed as being in feminized spaces and women disproportionately contribute entities in masculinized spaces.

Existing research has situated male and female OSM editors in a position in which we might expect a misalignment between their interest space. If this were true, a solution to any gender-based content disparity might be easy: attract more female editors. As our results show -this simply is not the case. Instead, our fndings reveal that male users are cognizant of at least some of the feminized spaces, and they actively map those facilities. This contradicts the way many prior researchers have been formulating thoughts and discussion of potential improvements to the amount and quality of feminized spaces in OSM [51,65,68,92]. In our dataset, female editors tended to map feminized places to a lesser extent than their male counterparts. As these spaces characterize important facilities for feminine health and nurturing of others, proper representation is necessary. However, our results point out that a straightforward solution like increasing female participation may not ensure increased representation of feminized spaces. We caution that our results should not be interpreted in a way that discourages higher levels of female participation. Rather we need to think critically about ways to increase coverage of under-represented facilities on OSM. One possible approach is the recruitment of male editors as \"allies\" along with more female participants and informing all editors of the state of the repository. Another solution may be to take the \"SuggestBot\" approach [25] and design a content recommendation system that will seek contributors based on location, interests, skills, etc. For example, a local person who is probably aware of nearby childcare centers or maternity clinics may be asked to map those places irrespective of their gender.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_18": "Our specifc procedure was as follows: First, we searched for the profle of a user in the OSM site, OSM Wiki [6] and OSM Help forum [7] and then attempted to infer gender from their profle image, listed real name or text description.

Users can interactively refine the layout by resolving ambiguity and adding constraints. While these techniques assist with grid design and alignment, layout construction is left to the designer.

However, their design is largely time consuming manual work. This is challenging due to combinatorial explosion and complex objectives, such as alignment, balance, and expectations regarding positions. This paper proposes a novel optimisation approach for the generation of diverse grid-based layouts. Our mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model offers a rigorous yet efficient method for grid generation that ensures packing, alignment, grouping, and preferential positioning of elements. Further, we present techniques for interactive diversification, enhancement, and completion of grid layouts. These capabilities are demonstrated using GRIDS, a wireframing tool that provides designers with real-time layout suggestions.

Access to diverse but relevant computationally generated suggestions could help them in exploring and enhancing designs [55], thus avoiding too early fixation [9]. Moreover, need for manual editing could be reduced if computer-generated designs were able to suggest completions to partially finalised designs. However, the algorithmic problems involved are non-trivial. Any such method must efficiently search within a very vast design space while reacting to real-time changes made by the designer. Prior to this work, it has not been known how to best define core features of a good grid layout. The more design objectives and concerns one can incorporate into the mathematical system, the less final editing is left to the designer. However, it is not known how to combine objectives that together ensure performant and aesthetically pleasing layouts. Elements must be well-aligned, key elements easily reachable, related elements logically grouped together, and so on.", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_para_4": "Combinatorial optimisation methods can find solutions, from a large design space, that satisfy a stated design objectives. Within the area of combinatorial geometry, grid layout has been studied in the context of 2D bin packing [37,42,50], rectangular packing [27], and the guillotine cuts problem [11]. An elementary version of the grid design problem has been previously proposed [27], but it merely attempts to find the most densely packed solution whereby the elements are squeezed together as closely as possible; there is no attempt to address aesthetics (like alignment) and no intent to explore multiple layouts. Optimisation has been used for resizing GUI elements [60], with the focus being on improving aesthetics of a layout by making subtle changes when the available space is varied. Previous research has also looked into generating optimised grid-based layouts. AIDE is a metrics-based tool to aid design and evaluation of UIs [52]. It included objectives such as balance, efficiency, and constraints. The optimiser computed a layout grid and used this to organise widgets. ADL is a layout engine that dynamically constructed grid layouts [3]. Given static elements, it filled up the remaining area with dynamic content . Typically, these approaches compute a single point-optimal solution. Following earlier findings, we believe it is necessary to present designers with a diverse range of solutions [2,55]. However, random-search based optimisation methods do not support generation of controllably diverse results. IP-based approaches have been previously used to generate, for example, keyboard layouts [32]. This allows for a structured search process and guaranteed bounds, thus improving outcomes and increasing designer confidence. More recently, AdaM employed IP to distribute UIs in multi-user environments [48]. While the formulation does address limited display size, the objectives, constraints, and applications differ substantially from ours.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_para_6": "Computational techniques have been proposed for designing layouts with designer in the loop. DesignScape [45] supports enhancement and exploration of single-page layouts using energy-based optimisation. The design principles here are limited to those learnt from a small set of examples, and optimisation is computationally-expensive. Sketchplorer [55] supports exploring, enhancing, and recolouring layouts. However, it employs black-box optimisation on a discrete canvas, which does not scale, resulting in poor performance for complex design tasks. Moreover, it does not address objectives of good grid layouts, such as rectangularity, alignment, or preferential placement. Genetic algorithms have been used to iteratively select promising interfaces from a collection of candidates [16]. Various constraints had to be placed to prevent inappropriate groupings in the layout, and to reduce the number of selections. Data-driven approaches enable layout generation without requiring problem specification [36,62]. However, results are limited to the domain of the training dataset, and offer no quality guarantees. In what comes close to our aims, a semi-automatic grid-based technique has been previously proposed [29]. Here, users constructed an example layout, which, as in this paper, was represented as an algorithmic task to generate layouts of any size. New examples were presented to the user, enabling them to steer the generation.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_para_1": "Our MILP model guarantees proper packing: all elements fit on the canvas without overflowing or overlapping.

Our work differs from this line of work in three key aspects: (1) Input: SUPPLE and its descendants require functional specifications as input. This is beneficial for application developers as they only need to specify what functions are exposed to users. On the contrary, our work targets UI designers who already have some ideas about desired layouts. It enables designers to define the design task by demonstration, including element types, and preferences regarding size and placement. (2) Layouting: When rendering an interface layout, SUPPLE used three heuristics to sequentially decide the layout -bottom-up, top-down, and minimum remaining values [22]. The key objective was to find a layout that satisfies user preferences, abilities, and device constraints. In contrast, our MILP formulation aims at constructing well-formed grid layouts, with desirable aesthetics, by considering the entire composition of the canvas.

Many established lines of work in HCI and ICTD explore how digital divides between the rural and the urban are engendered from uneven distributions of digital literacy, afordability, infrastructural support, etc. [19,41,80,97,112,136] However, how computational interventions contribute to dividing, disconnecting, or detaching the rural from the urban culturally and politically, is still largely understudied. This paper depicts some ramifcations of such computing praxis and argues that conceptualization of the complex rural-urban linkages is essential in HCI and ICTD studies to develop more inclusive, diverse, and 'just' design strategies.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_metadata": "Authors: A.

For example, Joode et al. found that both task conflict and affective conflict can occur in open source communities, especially when a contributor's software patch was unjustly rejected [41].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_metadata": "Authors: Jiahuan Zheng, Xin Peng, Jiacheng Yang, Huaqian Cai, Gang Huang, Ying Zhang, Wenyun Zhao | Venue: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work | Year: 2017 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_para_4": "Conflicts occur frequently in online collaboration settings due to a lack of shared context, limited information sharing channels, and weak interpersonal bonds between members [20]. Conflicts are especially common in the peer review process, in which people decide whether one's contributions should be accepted or not [42]. There are different forms of peer review in different online collaboration settings. In many software development projects, there is a formal peer review system where contributors propose code changes (e.g., pull-requests in GitHub) and reviewers decide whether the contribution should be accepted or not [40]. In Wikipedia, both formal peer review and informal peer review exists. For instance, featured articles (FA) are determined by a formal peer review process where group of editors decide whether candidate articles should be promoted to FA or not [1]. Additionally, any edit on Wikipedia articles could be viewed as being informally \"peer reviewed\" [37]. On most unprotected pages, any editors can \"review\" others' edits. If they don't like the edits, they can reject them by reverting or overwriting on them. In this paper, we focus on formal peer review systems where there are explicit roles like reviewers and submitters (which we refer as contributors in the following sections), and dedicated places to submit the review, discuss the review decision. Particularly, we examine what happens when the submitter openly disagrees with the reviewers (i.e., conflicts occur).", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

Our results show that, compared to giving explanations or social encouragement, providing concrete suggestions is the most effective way to manage conflict. Based on this finding, we suggest existing communities should educate members to try to understand the intent of the contributors and provide constructive suggestions when conflicts occur. The online collaboration systems should also support flexible interfaces for members to conveniently provide suggestions. In Wikipedia, newcomers' edits are often reverted without any further information. According to Halfaker's paper [17], this might be a cause of the slower growth of Wikipedia's editor base. They then proposed a tool to present newcomers' activity traces to Wikipedian mentors, and this information significantly helped mentors to provide more explanations about edit reverts [18].

In fact, in their quantitative study, Kidwell et al. [28] found a significant increase in data sharing of submissions to the Psychological Science journal that adapted to those badges. Based on our findings and design implications, we discuss five aspects explaining why those mechanisms had a positive impact. First, the badges allow promoting best practices that are considered highly important in the community. We employed similar mechanisms in our study that were very well received by participants. Second, while badges are visibly placed on the paper and in the digital library of participating journals, no adverse indication is given, highlighting that a paper has not yet received those awards. Third, promotion of rewarded papers increases their visibility, as well as the visibility of authors. This is especially true if search engines of digital libraries highlight corresponding search results. Through increased visibility, researchers can expect increasing citations and improved career prospects. Fourth, also the fact that badges are assigned to papers instead of individual researchers certainly fosters acceptance, as we have previously discussed. Finally, the badges provide accessible goals, a first step towards reproducibility. ACM takes this notion even further, introducing fine-grained badges that focus on very accessible goals [1,8]."}}

We interview 23 workgroup members about their account sharing practices at a U.S. university. Our study is the first to explicitly compare IT and non-IT observations of account sharing as a \"normal and easy\" workgroup practice, as well as to compare student practices with those of full-time employees. We contrast our results with those in prior works and offer recommendations for security design and for IT messaging. Our findings that account sharing is perceived as low risk by our participants and that security is seen as secondary to other priorities offer insights into the gap between technical affordances and social needs in an academic workplace such as this.?", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

Colnago et al. [14] documented the attitudes and behaviors surrounding twofactor authentication (2FA) as it was rolled out at a large research university. Regarding account sharing, the authors found that 2FA interfered with the ability of some students to share their financial accounts with parents, because the parents could only use the shared password at a time when the students were available to answer the 2FA push notification. They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities. They found that about half did not make their security policies publicly accessible, and that these policies were seldom consistent or shared source materials; moreover, the policies tended to be difficult to read, lacking in emotional language, and worded ambiguously and/or tentatively, such that the takeaways were unclear.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_metadata": "Authors: R.

The picture that emerges from our interview data ( Figure 1) contradicts our expectation that cybersecurity policies and procedures also would impact workgroups from a university IT and from personal level. In fact, many non-IT participants hold higher standards for their personal accounts versus their shared work accounts, since they feel that their work accounts do not contain financial or confidential data that are of interest to attackers. While their individual accounts may be of low interest, the network that the accounts are connected to is of high interest to attackers; a research university such as this controls hundreds of millions of dollars in financial assets and a substantial amount of sensitive data and intellectual property. Figure 1: A diagram of (above) the expectation that university messaging on cybersecurity will directly reach workgroups, and those workgroups and personal behaviors will reinforce each other; (below) the reality that emerges from our interview data is of disconnection. Our participants indicated that university policies are unknown to workgroups and strong personal practices do not permeate through the workgroup. The main influencer is what the workgroup as a collective decides upon.", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_metadata": "Authors: Martez E Mott, John Tang, Edward Cutrell | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_11": "Our study of account sharing is the first to explicitly compare the perspectives of IT and non-IT employees and to shed light on the practices of student employees vs. full-time employees. We also add qualitative insights from this setting to complement recent survey studies of account sharing within social contexts and extend findings from older studies of account sharing to the age of widespread personal account use. We found, as prior work did, that users in this university community share accounts to streamline workflows [57] and to save money [11,57]. These findings seem to demonstrate similar \"shadow security\" practices through temporary access as described in Kirlappos and Sasse [34] (to streamline workflows) and in Bartsch and Sasse [7] (to save money). We summarize comparisons of our results with themes in five prior works that deal with account sharing in Section 5.1.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_metadata": "Authors: Bin Liang, Qinglin Zhu, Xiang Li, Min Yang, Lin Gui, Yulan He, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_metadata": "Authors: Yasha Iravantchi, Mayank Goel, Chris Harrison | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_metadata": "Authors: Sebastian Deterding | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science, Psychology | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_metadata": "Authors: Shaomei Wu, Lindsay Reynolds, Xian Li, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2019 | Fields: Psychology, Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

The present work takes many of the insights developed in these models (e.g. the recurrent representation of spans (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016), and the use of a dynamic oracle and exploration policy during training (Goldberg and Nivre, 2013)) and extends these insights to span-oriented models, which support a wider range of decoding procedures. Our approach differs from other recent chart-based neural models (e.g. Durrett and Klein (2015)) in the use of a recurrent input representation, structured loss function, and comparatively simple parameterization of the scoring function. In addition to the globally optimal decoding procedures for which these models were designed, and in contrast to the left-to-right decoder typically employed by transition-based models, our model admits an additional greedy top-to-bottom inference procedure.", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_abstract": "To alleviate the error propagation in the traditional pipelined models for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing, we formulate AMR parsing as a joint task that performs the two subtasks: concept identi\ufb01cation and relation identi\ufb01cation simultaneously.

within which they can be actively engaged and use their spatial reasoning skills for data analysis. However, virtual worlds need to utilize layouts and organizational schemes that are meaningful to the user and beneficial for data analysis. This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display",

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

Data that is distributed along three properties creates a 3D scatter plot. Jeffery can use this action to explore the distribution of different properties, for example, by year. The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions.

Human Effort", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_abstract": "Neural module networks (NMN) are a popular approach for grounding visual referring expressions. Prior implementations of NMN use pre-defined and fixed textual inputs in their module instantiation. This necessitates a large number of modules as they lack the ability to share weights and exploit associations between similar textual contexts (e.g. \u201cdark cube on the left\u201d vs. \u201cblack cube on the left\u201d). In this work, we address these limitations and evaluate the impact of contextual clues in improving the performance of NMN models. First, we address the problem of fixed textual inputs by parameterizing the module arguments. This substantially reduce the number of modules in NMN by up to 75% without any loss in performance. Next we propose a method to contextualize our parameterized model to enhance the module\u2019s capacity in exploiting the visiolinguistic associations. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art NMN model on CLEVR-Ref+ dataset with +8.1% improvement in accuracy on the single-referent test set and +4.3% on the full test set. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextualization provides +11.2% and +1.7% improvements in accuracy over prior NMN models on CLOSURE and NLVR2. We further evaluate the impact of our contextualization by constructing a contrast set for CLEVR-Ref+, which we call CC-Ref+. We significantly outperform the baselines by as much as +10.4% absolute accuracy on CC-Ref+, illustrating the generalization skills of our approach.", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_4": "Neural Module Networks. Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse textual expressions as executable programs composed of learnable neural modules (Andreas et al., 2016b;Johnson et al., 2017a,b;Hu et al., 2017a). Each of these modules are specialized to compute basic reasoning tasks and can be assembled to perform complex and compositional reasoning. (Andreas et al., 2016b) used dependency trees (Zhu et al., 2013) to generate the execution layouts. (Andreas et al., 2016a) proposed dynamic NMNs that learns and adapts the structure of the execution layouts to the question. (Johnson et al., 2017b) proposed homogeneous (IEP) and generic neural modules, unlike fixed and hand-crafted neural module, in which the semantics of each neural module is learnt during training. IEP model achieves promising performance on CLEVR dataset. (Liu et al., 2019) proposed IEP-Ref by extending IEP model to CLEVR-Ref+ dataset and outperformed all the prior works. Although, compositional by design, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow and fail to ground novel combinations of known linguistic constructs (Bahdanau et al., 2019).

This is problematic as the modules are not given the opportunity to watch the neighborhood of textual input that helps in extracting the informative visiolinguistic context from the module's visual input. For example, the module filter_color[dark] needs to pick a black colored cube or a red-colored cube depending on the neighborhood context in the expression (e.g. \"the dark thing that is hardly visible\" vs. \"the dark thing among the red cubes\") and the type of cubes available in its visual input.

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image.

The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31]. Users tend to rely more on anticipation (their internal clock) than on reaction when the task becomes more difficult. Although simple, the model adequately addresses two quite different cases:", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_9": "The model provides a novel explanation to differences among input devices in temporal aspects of performance. It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_0": "When we started working on this topic, we were surprised to learn that temporal pointing is not addressed by predictive models in HCI. Fitts' law and its variants [8,9,33,40,10,24] are limited to the spatial domain. From Fitts' law's perspective, our scenario is trivial: as the finger is already on (or above) the button, travel distance is minimal and movement time constant (i.e., M T \u2248 a).

(2) The efect of mark orientation on trend accuracy would be most pronounced when residual bandwidth was large: that is, a small bandwidth would result in similar accuracy for diferent marks, while a large bandwidth would result in large diferences in accuracy across diferent marks. Prior work [7,21] shows that the dispersion of points infuences accuracy in trend and correlation judgments, with very high accuracy when dispersion from the trend is small. Insofar as we anticipated that mark orientation would guide or bias participants in their estimates, we suspected that the impact of this guidance would be less pronounced for stimuli where the dispersion is low and so accuracy is high in any event.", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_3": "Fitts' law [8] predicts minimum movement time M T with two spatial requirements: movement distance D s and target width W s . In other words, the user is asked to move as quickly as possible to hit the target. Fitts introduced the concept of index of difficulty: M T = a + bID s = a+b log 2 (2D s /W s ). Wobbrock et al. [40] analysed Fitts' law to derive a model of error rates with three task requirements mixed in the temporal and spatial domain: target size D s , target width W s , and temporal target distance D t . As this paper does, they predicted error rates, because there was an explicit requirement to maintain a temporal distance to the target D t . Besides, when the spatial requirement W s is relaxed from Fitts' task, targeting becomes more open-loop-like. Gan and Hoffman [9] proposed a model to predict M T when the goal is to hit a large target at distance D s . Hoffman's law originally predicted M T = a + b \u221a D s . With additional assumptions, it can be expressed as the constant ratio between D s and the standard deviation (SD) of end points [12].", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_4": "We performed a repeated measures rANOVA analysis for understanding fve factors: number of outliers, mark shape, outlier distance to the major cluster, outlier location, as well as outlier density. For analyzing the efect of the outlier distance, we computed all stimuli and then quantized them into fve nonuniform groups based on the ratio of cluster centroid distance and the correlation of main cluster. In the supplementary materials we discuss other factors for which we did not have strong or relevant hypotheses. Mark Orientation. In accordance to our hypothesis, mark orientation had a signifcant efect on the accuracy of the estimations for trend orientation (F (3, 210) = 5.06, p < .05) and trend intercept (F (3, 216) = 5.86, p < .001). As shown in Fig. 10, marks pointing towards the direction of the robust trend (Tri-R) created less error with respect to the robust trend. Similarly, marks pointing towards the full OLS line (Tri-O) produced less error with respect to this line, while the other two marks perform similarly. Our results also support the fnding of Correll & Heer [7] that participants downweighted outlying points when making trend estimates. For the following analyses we therefore used the robust trend line as our basis of comparison. Results for estimating intercepts can be found in the supplemental materials. Outlier Distance. Corresponding to our hypothesis, outlying clusters further away from the remaining points were considered less important for trend estimation. With increasing distance of the outlying cluster our participants produced estimations closer to the robust trend line. We observed that the distance had an extremely signifcant efect on the estimation accuracy with respect to the robust trend orientation (F (4, 284) = 27.94, p < .0001) and the intercept (F (4, 293) = 29.03, p < .0001).

In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled.

Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

Many of our participants reported mentally drawing a bounding box for all points, and then removing outliers. Since the trend is not strictly determined by these perceptual proxies [14,18], we cannot directly compute how these global or local visual structures were used. In the future, we will quantitatively model how the estimated trend is related to these proxies and to model a larger set of mark shapes and sizes. Since participants might have used diferent strategies for dealing with outliers (e.g., considering or discarding) in Experiment 2, the efects of outliers are likely to difer based on the individual strategy . In the future, we will model individual diferences and preform a secondary analysis of the experimental data as did by Kay and Heer [15]. In addition, we are particularly interested in how the mark size (and its infuence on visual artifacts like overplotting and occlusion) could skew assessments of local density and the resulting estimated trend. We are also interested in expanding our study of data-driven orientation to wider use cases, especially under additional \"adversarial\" scatterplot conditions [18] (such as marks with transparency, high degrees of overplotting, nonlinear or non-uniform trends, or where likely perceptual proxies like bounding boxes are uninformative).", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_abstract": "A common task for scatterplots is communicating trends in bivariate data. However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_0": "We base our experimental methods on those employed by Correll & Heer [7].

Participants then manipulated a trend line with a slider until they felt that it matched the trend in the data, with the error measured as the diference (both absolute and signed) in the user defned trend and the actual source trend.

To our knowledge, there is no model of target interception that would consider the case of temporal pointing wherein the spatial task requirement is negligible. Anticipation-coincidence studies [17,3] and the Newell group's work [22,11,23,16,13] have offered a mixed view, wherein temporal and spatial requirements co-exist. Two distinct categories of existing models can be recognised: 1) models assuming preprogrammed responses and 2) on-line control models. There has been some criticism of these models [35]. One critical issue is that several strategies are possible. For example, when one is capturing a target, four distinct strategies have been identified (pursuit, head-on, receding, and perpendicular) [35]. The strategy is affected by how the target moves, its identity, whether it is to be captured or hit, and how it is approached. One replicated finding is that when moving targets require more temporal precision (smaller W t ), people increase the movement velocity [36,4,34]. However, faster movement also decreases spatial precision, as Schmidt's law predicts. This has been explained by reference to a process that maintains optimal strategy between spatial and temporal precision [32,41]. In summary, although interception is a generalisation of both spatial and temporal pointing, at present no model is able to predict performance in our case -i.e., when spatial task requirements are virtually non-existent.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_4": "Schmidt's law [33] adds one temporal requirement to Gan and Hoffman's model, time to target D t .

The law predicts that SD (in the spatial domain) is linearly related to movement velocity. If time to the target D t is controlled, SD increases linearly with spatial distance D s . In this case, the model is the same as that of Hoffman et al. [9,12]. Guiard et al. [10] recently presented the most comprehensive model of spatial aiming. The WHo model explains different aspects of spatial movement by reference to six axioms of human movement. That model subsumes Fitts' law and Schmidt's law by reference to a trade-off phenomenon among the axioms.

However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

Zhang et al. (2017) reduced the search space of semantic parsers by using coarse macro grammars. Different from the previous work, we apply the idea of coarse-to-fine into cross-domain slot filling to handle unseen slot types by separating the slot filling task into two steps (Zhai et al., 2017;Guerini et al., 2018).", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \"idle\" fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_metadata": "Authors: Devamardeep Hayatpur, Haijun Xia, Daniel J.

Classic approach to sense stimulation in VR consists of attaching a display to the relevant sensing organ [30]. Although this is effective for stimulation of vision and hearing (senses with relatively small sensing organs), it is much more difficult problem to stimulate the surface of the skin, the largest organ on the human body [8].

(Center) When one primary finger is engaged in touch interaction, the rest of the secondary \"idle\" fingers (blue) are still but are able to move. We utilize these idle fingers to perform various hand poses before a touch or in-air gestures during a touch to add modality and expressiveness to the primary touch event: (a) opening a file by tapping with a \"Basic\" hand pose, (b) opening a context menu of the file by tapping with a \"Spread All\" hand pose, (c) deleting the touched object with the index finger by flicking with the thumb and (d) drawing a line with the index finger while controlling the width of the brush stroke by swiping up/down with the thumb. finger input (e.g., thumb's contact size [2] and different parts of a finger [11]) for a richer touch input vocabulary. However, the limited interaction space provided by two-dimensional (2D) touch interfaces falls significantly short of the rich gestural capabilities of human fingers.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_5": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use changes in a user's field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a mechanism for integration.

Using EEG to monitor neural activity can offer access to a user's preattentive processing state, resulting in possibilities for integration where the system responds to a situation \"before\" the user can with their body. This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_4": "More recent works have addressed the combination of touch and gestures in order to provide more expressive interactions. Marguardt et al. [22] proposed a unification of touch and gestures called the \"continuous interaction space\" on a digital surface. Also, TouchID [23] led to novel and expressive tabletop interaction techniques by identifying which hand and which part of the hand was touching the surface, as well as what posture and what gesture was being enacted with the fiduciarytagged glove. Similarly, Finger-Aware Shortcuts [36] employed finger, hand, and posture identification for keyboards to provide shortcut availability and expressivity. In this system, a key press can have multiple command mappings depending on which fingers and postures were used to press a key. Jackson et. al. [15] also extend multi-touch interfaces by using a combination of multi-touch gestures and 3D movements of the hand(s) above the surface. Furthermore, Kim et al. [18] and Song et al. [27] augmented touch events on mobile devices with finger gestures by using both hands. One hand controls a touch device, while the other hand performs gestures as an additional input. Conversely, Hinckley et. al. [13] explored interaction techniques with one hand for hand-held devices that leverage the combination of touch and motion, suggesting hybrid touch+motion gestures. In addition, Expressy [33], using only one hand, employed the movement of the wrist to add expressiveness to touch-based interactions. Air+Touch [5] focused on in-air gestures performed only with the thumb to enhance touch interaction while the same hand grasped the phone. Also, by using thumb-based touch gestures on capacitive touch sensors in a ring-like device, Ringteraction [9] presented thumb-index touch interaction, which allowed for enhanced input modalities on handheld devices.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

SideSwipe [35] also leverages the unmodified global system for mobile communication (GSM) signal to enable in-air hand gestures above and at the side of a mobile device. Arefin Shimon et. al., [1] explored hand gestures above a smartwatch in order to overcome the limited interaction space of the small screen.

For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation"}}

First, as an entry point into this large dataset, we were interested in understanding the overall nature of the bots requested and created by this community, in particular the issues they address and their technical functionalities. We therefore first conducted a Content Analysis [16,35], inductively coding each submission to capture initial patterns related to (i) the types of topics, issues and tasks users requested or created bots for, and (ii) the types of functionalities and technical features that underpinned requested and created bots. Second, we were interested in the discussions surrounding bots on the Reddit platform. As such, we conducted a Thematic Analysis of all submission and comment data. Following [9], we coded individual submissions and comments, when necessary at the sentence to paragraph level, to summarise content for semantic and latent meaning. Once all data was coded, we compared and contrasted codes, grouped related codes together, and used these as the starting point for creating themes. Finally, we selected exemplar data as evidence of talk underpinning themes to be presented as part of our findings. The coding process across both stages was conducted by three researchers, who regularly met to share codes, discuss different interpretations of data, and to refine codes and subsequent themes.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_2": "As well as these wider social, technical and political implications of bot use, there is growing recognition of the important role bots play in automating otherwise burdensome and repetitive processes on platforms such as Wikipedia [11,36] and Slack [33]. Cl\u017dment and Guitton [11] categorise bots on Wikipedia into two opposing ideotypes: \u00d4servant\u00d5 bots performing laborious work in place of human volunteers (e.g. correcting grammatical error); and \u00d4policing\u00d5 bots enforcing guidelines and norms. They note how the users of these bots predictably perceive them as servant collaborators under their control, yet users disapprove of \u00d4servant\u00d5 bots unwantedly performing numerous interfering actions across a large number of pages. Furthermore, \u00d4policing\u00d5 bots are perceived to be limiting and constraining, making contributors feel as though bots were aggressively controlling purportedly voluntary decisions. This tension and potential conflict between human and bot editors on Wikipedia has been explored by Geiger both in terms of how bots fit within established roles [18] and what happens where bots that perform vital roles fail [19].", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

We observed nuanced cocreation processes surrounding proposing, discussing, motivating, releasing and maintaining a bot. We saw the ways in which the suggestion of bot ideas, the receiving of feedback on these ideas from a supportive community of developers, and then the iteration of these through discussion, enabled lay community members to see their initial ideas come to life. We also observed how existing bots became exemplars and prototypes on which new ideas were built. They became ways to peek behind the curtain of bot design and implementation. In some cases this was through watching the trial and error of a creator. In others it was through learning new coding skills themselves via the help and support of more experienced peers. As such, while there was in some cases no exchange of code the interactions observed were akin to forms of legitimate peripheral participation [31] observed in open source communities [13,68] and in situated studies of learning programing skills [13,49]. Therefore, while there were clearly challenges associated with the creation of bot ideas requested by novices, there is great potential to see acts of making bots as sites where the mysterious \u00d2black box\u00d3 of technology can be unpicked and understood. In the following sections we discuss three areas where future work might support such bot making, and reflect on the value of studying bots as a way of understanding online communities.

We saw how many people simply have no idea what bots are at a functional level, how they act and react to data, or how sophisticated they can and cannot be. This included little understanding of the technical fundamentals of bots; budding botsmiths did not appreciate the additional infrastructure required to host and operate bots, nor understand the most basic of programming and networking competencies required to realise their idea. There were also issues around the possibilities and limitations of the APIs that serve as the lifeblood of any bot. In addition to these technical matters, there were issues of expectation around richness of interaction, such as a bots\u00d5 ability to understand context or subtleties of language, perhaps in part due to the cultural mythology that surrounds robots and artificial intelligence [55]. This speaks to wider contemporary issues where the public have little awareness or understanding of the software processes that shape and constrain the things we see online [9]. In many respects, these raise deep concerns about the potential to engage wider publics in probing and questioning the roles software agents play in society.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_0": "Social media platforms have recently seen a proliferation of automated software agents, known as bots, which can monitor and participate in simple online communication. The current scale of online bot activity is remarkable, with bots being responsible for 24% of all activity on Twitter [54]. While their purpose on social media varies widely, bots are characterized by routine behaviours that often respond to other activity according to some designed criteria. For instance, if someone used the phrase \u00d2illegal immigrant\u00d3 on Twitter in July 2015, they might have received an automated reply from \u00d2@DroptheIBot\u00d3 [24] suggesting they rethink on their terminology and use the term \u00d2undocumented immigrant\u00d3 instead. Bots deployed on social media platforms are often quick to gain notoriety. Through these platforms\u00d5 low barriers to social interaction, bots propagate news [34] and political opinion [8]; they counter, respond to and correct statements made by users (such as @DroptheIBot); they name and shame users based on the things they say or content they share [47]; help users appeal parking tickets without needing lawyers [61]; publish generative art (e.g. @MothGenerator); give directions to mysterious places [28]; and attempt humour (e.g @AmIRiteBot). Outside of social media, bots are also an established feature of communities such as Wikipedia, Slack and Reddit, where they provide ways to automate the standard protocols that govern platform content and perform other tasks that are time-consuming for human administrators [11,33,36,52]. However, poor design and implementations of bots can have negative effects. Microsoft\u00d5s Tay Twitter bot [42] was quickly pulled when, influenced by mischievous human peers, it began to post highly offensive racist, sexist and homophobic material. Bots gained further notoriety in expos\u017ds of the dating site Ashley Madison in which it was revealed that many customer interactions with seemingly real users were, in fact, with bots [32].! The recent proliferation of bots has been supported by the development of new tools and services which have lowered barriers to their creation and deployment. The availability of simple, well-documented application programming interfaces (APIs) that support ever more accessible languages and frameworks opens bot creation to novice developers. Meya [63], Labnol [3] and \u00d2Cheap Bots Done Quick\u00d3 [60] provide tools that allow non-developers to design, create and deploy simple bots without writing a line of code. The Weavrs platform gained widespread notoriety [2] for facilitating the creation, at the press of a button, of relatively unsophisticated but strikingly effective and subversive Twitter bots seeded with existing profiles of real celebrities. A recent well-publicised online tutorial describing \u00d2How to Make a Twitter Bot in Under an Hour: Even if you don\u00d5t code that often!\u00d3 [43] contributes to an expanding set of reference material regarding the process of making bots. Furthermore, events such as \u00d2Bot Summit\u00d3 [27] and \u00d2Art of Bots\u00d3 [59]) offer bot-making enthusiasts opportunities to talk about bots, collaboratively make them, swap expertise and offer help.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_1": "A significant amount of prior work has focused on problematic aspects of bots, such as their use in attacking websites or online services (e.g. [8,57]) or their impersonation of humans (e.g. [10,46]). Motivated by allegations around democratic votes in both Europe and the US, Forelle et al [17], Baker [6], and the wider research community at politicalbots.org have highlighted the widespread use of bots to disseminate and influence political opinion, \u00d4to boost follower numbers and to retweet the content of political candidates on Twitter, to attack political opponents on Facebook, or to drown out activists\u00d5 conversations on Reddit\u00d5 [58, p4885]. Likewise, Larsson and Moe [30] note the need for researchers and platform developers to deepen their understandings of how bot accounts influence and propagate news and media distribution. Relatedly, Savage et al [48] present an approach for using Twitter bots as a mechanism for calling volunteers to action around social causes, highlighting the ease with which changing the tone of the language expressed by a bot can influence engagement from human social media users [48]. The growing abundance of bot code shared on platforms such as GitHub opens even further opportunities and lowers the level of expertise needed to tailor, deploy and use these software agents for personal, social or political causes [29].", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_7": "As reported, there were many examples where those who were proposing bots struggled to express their ideas, could not elaborate on initial propositions, or simply had a very limited knowledge of what was technically feasible. There is potential here, however, for exploring the ways in which online environments might be designed or reconfigured to support the expression of ideas around software agents. Inspiration might be found here in literature that has examined the ways in which other online platforms support exchanges of knowledge and advice between expert and novice coders [26]. For example, Asaduzzaman et al [5] have examined why requests for help get left unresolved on platforms like StackOverflow\u00d1they highlight that those questions that are \u00d4too short, unclear, vague or hard to follow\u00d5, too specific or perceived to involve too much work often get ignored. Contrastingly, Nashei et al [38] highlight that good questions on the same platform tend to encourage continued discussion where the initial problem gets redefined. Similarly, those responses that work best tend to be those that are concise, refer back to the question asked, highlight key elements, and provide step-by-step instructions and explore multiple solutions. Furthermore, studies of expert online communities of programmers have highlighted the importance of timely responses, both from those asking a question and those proposing answers [40].", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_8": "While a significant amount of collaborative practice around design in HCI orientates itself towards enabling conditions where participants can be open-minded [15], withhold judgement [56] and imagine radically different futures [14], in many respects the opposite issue is the matter of concern here.

It is often claimed that digital technologies can be \u00d2black boxes\u00d3 that are \u00d4impermeable, inflexible, and unviewable\u00d5 [37]. Indeed, consumer products are critiqued for creating conditions where these hidden innards disable people from appropriating, re-making and engaging in their own practices of design [53]. Therefore, we might take inspiration from attempts to support DIY practices around maker technologies and kits for experimentation with input and output platforms [53]. Simple tools that provide exemplar functions and types of data that act as bot \u00d2building blocks\u00d3 might offer a starting point for guided experimentation. One way of doing so might be to present already existing and typical designs that require completing (as suggested by [44]) through adding or taking away component blocks that represent specific functionality. In doing so, we might more carefully scaffold learning through safe experimentation, and also extend the current positive examples we saw where exemplar bots would be used as a starting point to inspire or ideate a new bot creation by more novice users.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_3": "Perhaps unsurprisingly, significant amounts of research on bots has focused on preventing them being used in the first place.

Others have studied bots to develop tools to understanding the propagation of SPAM on social media [57], and have developed techniques to detect bots based on content of tweets [10] and comparing bot-based accounts to those operated by humans [1]. This has led to the development of tools such as BotOrNot [12] which aids social media users to distinguish whether an account is operated by a person or an automated agent; and \u00d2Stweeler\u00d3, which supports the analysis of the impact and influence of bots on Twitter [20].", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_2": "AI-powered conversational user interfaces, also known as AI chatbots or chatbots for short, allow users to communicate with computers in natural language, providing more flexible [5] and personalized user experience [69].

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_13": "Node Datasets (\"No-bots\" and \"With-bots\").

To detect bot changeset 2 edits, we used fles downloaded from planet.osm [4]. Following prior work [55,83,99,100], we marked edits as 'bot edits' when they came from a changeset containing edits in very large quantities (more than 4,000 edits) or at a very fast rate (more than one edit per second).

Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116]. Besides these moderation rules, we also use the \"nest level\" of a comment as a control.

Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_19": "The CFA's results reveal that there is a clear connection between theory and social media discussions, and also show which key rhetoric components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse describe user interactions in our sample (RQ1). Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).",

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user.

However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_6": "Initial work from Correll & Heer [7] suggests that people are able to perform a general sort of \"regression by eye\" with simple Gaussian stimuli and a single class of outliers. However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_7": "However, the bias introduced by data-driven marks is small when the trend line is more certain. This is the case if the residual bandwidth is small, outliers are far away from the major cluster or have diferent densities, or if the intermingled clusters have radically diferent slopes. In such cases there is little ambiguity in the trend, and so estimates are accurate even without guidance from mark orientation. Implications for Scatterplot Design. The above fndings suggest that mark orientation can be a visual cue to implicitly encode trend information. A trend line directly encodes the model in a dogmatic way, whereas data-driven marks act as less dogmatic guidance that can be ignored or downweighted when they seem inappropriate or are clearly at odds with the depicted data, functioning as a form of \"implicit uncertainty visualization\" [6]. We have shown viewers will, in their own visual estimates, ignore things like outliers that would be a problem for explicit trend lines based on models of insufcient complexity. Fig. 19 shows how data-driven marks could be used to disambiguate trends in a health care dataset for investigating how the blood pressure is related to sodium excretion [11]. We can see that the slopes of the OLS trend and the robust trend have opposing signs (see Fig. 19(a)). Using data-driven marks can suggest a resolution to this ambiguity for the reviewer by downweight (b) or reinforcing (c) the contribution of the outlying points to the overall trend. Although it is hard to make a fair comparison between such implicit and explicit trend visualizations (for instance, Correll & Heer [7] believed that participants would adhere to explicit trend lines so closely if present that they used such stimuli as action checks), we believe that data-driven orientation can assist in regression by eye, especially for cases where standard models like OLS are inappropriate, or there are multiple valid interpretations of the data (as in Xiong et al. [34]).", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_9": "There is an extensive body of works on graphical perception tasks in scatterplots. Rensink [20] states that, much as geneticists use model organisms with simple genomes to model more complex behavior, scatterplots can function as \"fruit fies\" for graphical perception research questions in visualization. Scatterplots become especially important when moving beyond atomic tasks such as extraction and comparison of individual values that are common in foundational graphical perception work such as Cleveland & McGill [5] to \"ensemble\" tasks [27] such as the perception of average value and variance. The assessment of a trend is such an ensemble task, potentially requiring viewers to consider every point in the scatterplot in a holistic way, although recent work [14,18] suggests that \"perceptual proxies\" such as point envelopes and ranges likely guide visual statistical judgments in scatterplots rather than explicit calculations.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_2": "(1) Mark orientation would have a strong efect on trend estimation: an orientation consistent with the trend direction results in a higher accuracy. In other words, we expect mark shapes to guide or bias the estimates of the participants. Prior work indicates that carefully designed mark orientation can direct the perception of cluster structures in scatterplots [3,17]. (2) The efect of mark orientation on trend accuracy would be most pronounced when residual bandwidth was large: that is, a small bandwidth would result in similar accuracy for diferent marks, while a large bandwidth would result in large diferences in accuracy across diferent marks. Prior work [7,21] shows that the dispersion of points infuences accuracy in trend and correlation judgments, with very high accuracy when dispersion from the trend is small. Insofar as we anticipated that mark orientation would guide or bias participants in their estimates, we suspected that the impact of this guidance would be less pronounced for stimuli where the dispersion is low and so accuracy is high in any event.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_5": "To generate scatterplots with varying densities, we fxed a point Set A and then merged it with another point Set B whose number of points and slope could be adjusted. Specifcally, we frst created a Set A with 40 points, slope of \u03b2 = 1 and residual bandwidth of \u03c3 = 0. Here, we only analyzed 4 slopes instead of 8 (positive and negative) for two reasons: i) we had already studied efect of trend slope sign on trend estimation in our previous experiments and had no strong hypotheses around an interaction with cluster density (see Fig. 7) and ii) mixing a positive trend in Set A with a negative trend in Set B can only produce small regions with non-uniform densities. The number of total stimuli was therefore 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 = 96 stimuli plus 4 additional validation stimuli synthesized by Eq. 1 as attention checks for this experiment. Fig. 13 shows six examples generated by merging the green and orange point sets with overlaid green and orange trend lines. Figs. 13(a,b,c) demonstrate that changing the number of points in one set with a fxed slope infuences the perceived density. On the other hand, changing the trend slope while keeping the number of points unchanged infuences the bounding boxes, as shown in Figs. 13(d,e,f). Since bounding boxes are an efcient visual proxy for the perception of the correlations in scatterplots [36], we speculated that the size of the bounding box might also impact the visual estimates of the trends. Note that the colors used in Fig. 13 are for illustrative purposes only, Fig. 14 shows an example stimuli used in the experiment. Mark Orientation. As with the prior experiments, we used static marks (circles and Tri-Up) as well as a set of marks with data-driven orientations. In this case, the triangle marks were rotated towards the orientation of the trend of Set A (Tri-A) or Set B (Tri-B), which serves as the upper or lower bound of the orientation of the user ft. In particular, Tri-A was fxed with 45 \u2022 , while the orientation of Tri-B was a value in the set of {5.7 \u2022 , 11.3 \u2022 , 21.8 \u2022 , 38.7 \u2022 }.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_0": "We base our experimental methods on those employed by Correll & Heer [7]. The authors created scatterplots based on an initial set of Gaussian residuals of varying bandwidths (corresponding to an increasing level of dispersion) to which a particular trend was added, allowing orthogonal control over the slope of the trend line and the dispersion of the points (c.f. Rensink & Balridge [21] and Harrison et al. [12] in which correlation and slope are entangled). Participants then manipulated a trend line with a slider until they felt that it matched the trend in the data, with the error measured as the diference (both absolute and signed) in the user defned trend and the actual source trend. We extend and modify their methods to address the specifc case of marks with inherent orientations and more complex data distributions.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_8": "Our interview results show that participants report that they estimate trends by combining bounding boxes and local densities. Many of our participants reported mentally drawing a bounding box for all points, and then removing outliers. Since the trend is not strictly determined by these perceptual proxies [14,18], we cannot directly compute how these global or local visual structures were used. In the future, we will quantitatively model how the estimated trend is related to these proxies and to model a larger set of mark shapes and sizes. Since participants might have used diferent strategies for dealing with outliers (e.g., considering or discarding) in Experiment 2, the efects of outliers are likely to difer based on the individual strategy . In the future, we will model individual diferences and preform a secondary analysis of the experimental data as did by Kay and Heer [15]. In addition, we are particularly interested in how the mark size (and its infuence on visual artifacts like overplotting and occlusion) could skew assessments of local density and the resulting estimated trend. We are also interested in expanding our study of data-driven orientation to wider use cases, especially under additional \"adversarial\" scatterplot conditions [18] (such as marks with transparency, high degrees of overplotting, nonlinear or non-uniform trends, or where likely perceptual proxies like bounding boxes are uninformative).", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_1": "We chose synthetic stimuli to be able to compare our work with prior approaches such as [7,12,18,21], which in most cases use synthetic stimuli. A second reason was to have precise control over the features in the scatterplots. This allows us to directly assess our research questions (which primarily dealt with the robustness and feasibility of data-driven marks under specifc conditions). Mark Shape and Orientation. While there exists a vast palette of potential mark shape options for which we would anticipate difering patterns of perceptual judgments [8], we focus on triangles and circles, which are the most widely used marks. For example, over 97% of all single-class scatterplots in the VizNet [13] dataset use one of those two mark types. Besides a default upward oriented orientation, we test triangles rotated using data-driven factors, with circles as a default option without inherent orientation. We also found that most triangle marks in VizNet [13] dataset are equilateral triangles; thus, while isosceles triangles have less ambiguity in their encoding of orientation, we use equilateral triangles. Additionally, unlike isosceles triangles, the exact center of equilateral triangles is easier to estimate, which might have benefts for distributional estimation tasks.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_3": "(1) Mark orientation would afect trend estimation: we believed that a mark orientation consistent with the robust trend line would encourage participants to ignore or otherwise downweight outliers. As with the prior experiment an prior work [3,17], we anticipated that marks orientation might bias or guide judgments. (2) The distance between outliers and the major cluster would afect trend estimation: as the distance between outlier cluster and major point cluster centroids increased, we anticipated that participants would downweight the outlying clusters when making their estimates. Prior work shows that participants downweight (but did not entirely discount) outliers when performing trend estimation [7], although only with very distance outliers. We wanted to explore the placement of outliers in greater detail. (3) The density diference between outliers and major trend has a signifcant efect: with increasing density diference between main trend and outliers, participants would more easily ignore outliers. Previous research indicates that density diference afects human judgments in visual clustering [23].", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_10": "Much existing work focuses on the perception of correlations in scatterplots [12,15,21,25,32,36], often involving pairwise comparisons on which of two scatterplots contain data that is more highly correlated. The perception of a particular trend, however, is comparatively under-explored. Correll & Heer [7] fnd that human estimations of trends in simple gaussian stimuli are largely similar to the results of methods like OLS, except for biases introduced by the design of a visualization or the presence of outlying points. We reanalyze their results and discuss modifications of their experimental methods in the following section.", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_4": "We performed a repeated measures rANOVA analysis for understanding fve factors: number of outliers, mark shape, outlier distance to the major cluster, outlier location, as well as outlier density. For analyzing the efect of the outlier distance, we computed all stimuli and then quantized them into fve nonuniform groups based on the ratio of cluster centroid distance and the correlation of main cluster. In the supplementary materials we discuss other factors for which we did not have strong or relevant hypotheses. Mark Orientation. In accordance to our hypothesis, mark orientation had a signifcant efect on the accuracy of the estimations for trend orientation (F (3, 210) = 5.06, p < .05) and trend intercept (F (3, 216) = 5.86, p < .001). As shown in Fig. 10, marks pointing towards the direction of the robust trend (Tri-R) created less error with respect to the robust trend. Similarly, marks pointing towards the full OLS line (Tri-O) produced less error with respect to this line, while the other two marks perform similarly. Our results also support the fnding of Correll & Heer [7] that participants downweighted outlying points when making trend estimates. For the following analyses we therefore used the robust trend line as our basis of comparison. Results for estimating intercepts can be found in the supplemental materials. Outlier Distance. Corresponding to our hypothesis, outlying clusters further away from the remaining points were considered less important for trend estimation. With increasing distance of the outlying cluster our participants produced estimations closer to the robust trend line. We observed that the distance had an extremely signifcant efect on the estimation accuracy with respect to the robust trend orientation (F (4, 284) = 27.94, p < .0001) and the intercept (F (4, 293) = 29.03, p < .0001).

Furthermore, there seems to be a qualitative diference between closed and open shapes [4] for the assessments of similarity and diference within classes [8]. Despite this potential impact, many (or even most) visualizations rely on default mark shapes [2], typically circles. Of particular interest to us is the work by Ziemkiewicz & Kosara on the \"implied dynamics\" [37] of visualizations. Their work on marks in scatterplots specifcally suggests that \"attractor\" points [38] can create a bias for results of graphical perception tasks (even to the extent of irrational decision-making, as pointed out by Dimara et al.

The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions.

We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled. With respect to the two potential mediators meditation experience and daily self-reported motivation, we found that meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies (M = 1.

Yet, researchers often struggle to find the motivation to contribute to data repositories and to use tools that foster reproducibility. In this paper, we explore possible uses of gamification to support reproducible practices in High Energy Physics. To understand how gamification can be effective in research tools, we participated in a workshop and performed interviews with data analysts. We then designed two interactive prototypes of a research preservation service that use contrasting gamification strategies. The evaluation of the prototypes showed that gamification needs to address core scientific challenges, in particular the fair reflection of quality and individual contribution. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes which describe perceptions and requirements of gamification in research: Contribution, Metrics, Applications and Scientific practice. Based on these, we discuss design implications for gamification in science.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_metadata": "Authors: Nusrat Jahan Mim | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

In this paper, we explore possible uses of gamification to support reproducible practices. Past efforts attempted to stimulate good scientific practices through open science badges. They have been shown to significantly impact research data sharing practices of publications in the Psychological Science journal [28]. Yet, little empirical knowledge exists on the moderating effects of individual gamification mechanisms in professional scientific settings. In fact, it has recently been argued that mapping the impact of game design elements on specific domains is indeed much needed in gamification research today [31].", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_metadata": "Authors: Iuliia Avgustis | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_metadata": "Authors: Luis A.

In sum, the diverse studies on maker technologies for assistive technology provide a mixed and nuanced view of their potential for disabled people, and when deployed in a school environment. While certain studies highlight benefts in terms of cost [41], accessibility [39], ft [39,77], and reducing stigma [16,77], other studies suggest that a making practice does not to align with a clinical practice [37], and still presents barriers for adoption, such as a lack of ease-of-use or physical infrastructure [77]. In a school environment, researchers additionally foreground the time-consuming process and the need for researchers to consider how to ensure uptake after researchers leave the feld [71]. Finally, several researchers stress the lack of diversity in DIY practices, leading to DFO instead [37]. Similar echos can be found when scrutinizing DIY practices in realms beyond AT; for example several authors have published critical refections on the promises of DIY maker technology used in a generic school environment [4, 75, e.g.]. Ames et al., also similar to Hofman and Meisner [37,56], question who is in control, who gets excluded, and what making could contribute to society [3]. Regarding inclusion, Marshall and Rode deconstruct the sociotechnical identity formation within maker culture through an ethnographic study of STEAM skill building activities [55]. The study found complex tensions regarding gender and (maker) technology excluding those who do not identify as male. Therefore, the question remains how maker technologies can be help to design assistive technologies that truly empower, helping \"people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over issues of concern to them\" [43] in a school environment. Regarding the use of DIY assistive technology in schools for disabled children, there is still not enough research that support the promises of empowerment in this specifc environment.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_1": "In these settings, maker technology holds the promise of providing afordable and customizable technology solutions to pressing issues; for example, maker technologies have been envisioned as the solution to designing and building assistive technology in an efort to address the lack of afordable and customizable technical support systems for disabled people 1 [12,16]. Moreover, the aspiration is that the agency in the technology creation process, now reserved to HCI researchers, through DIY approaches, can be handed over to the people who want and need it [68]. In these cases, emphasis is placed on the potential of making as a means of empowering those who are perceived as disempowered [11], understanding empowerment as the \"processes and outcomes relating to issues of control and access to resources, critical awareness of the socio-political environment, and participation with others\" [89].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_abstract": "Maker culture encourages do-it-yourself practices to create, repair, and repurpose technology. In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, it is seen as a means of empowering people, providing affordable and customisable technology with potential to enrich areas such as education or assistive technology. To investigate this alleged potential, we performed an anthropological inquiry at an elementary school for disabled children that lasted one year, participating in everyday activities with students, teachers, and therapists. We observed \u2018heterogeneity in a fluid environment\u2019 and \u2018creativity in the moment\u2019 in an \u2018endemically underfunded\u2019 setting.

Instead, the research turned out to be humbling, realising certain challenges are not to be resolved through technology alone. In the course of our analysis, this research also transformed us in to activists, recognizing how the structural underfunding refects social injustice and in fact can be regarded as structural violence against children with disabilities [28]. Because of the underfunding, at times, even basic services could not always be met (e.g., the bus service). During the course of this research, several articles appeared in popular press echoing the fndings in this school and across other nations.

Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]). However, this individualistic perspective overlooks how students, teachers and therapists are afected by the organisations within which they operate, and which in turn are impacted on a societal level, thereby risking to undermine ongoing processes of empowerment.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_12": "Hence, despite their promising characteristics, we assume that when designed and introduced without a deep level of participation and understanding of the diferent levels and complexities of empowerment in the socio-cultural deployment setting, maker technologies will in fact create additional barriers to empowerment. From earlier research on the use of and barriers to DIY technologies, we already learned about the challenges with respect to efort expectancy and the lack of facilitating conditions [77], the lack of alignment with clinical practice [37], the time-consuming process of confguration and adding content due to openness of DIY toolkits [52], and the lack of representation of end-users in the design [11], resulting in design for others [56]. Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59].

However, as pointed out by Schneider et al. [72], the current discourse in HCI is characterized by a fuzzy understanding and delineation of what exactly is meant with empowerment. Schneider et al., building on the afore defnition of empowerment by Rappaport [43] highlight the many diferent conceptualizations of empowerment in HCI, distinguishing four dimensions in which empowerment can be understood: 1) envisioning empowerment either as power-to (i.e., the ability to act) or power-over (power in relation to others); 2) the psychological component of empowerment, distinguishing feeling, knowing and doing; 3) the persistence of empowerment, being either transient or persistent; and fnally 4) the design mindset, either expert-led or participatory. While the authors do not promote one conceptualization of empowerment over another, they point out that it is important for scholars to articulate their specifc stance and consequent decisions when investigating or designing for empowerment. When elaborating on the diferent dimensions of, and in particular the psychological component of empowerment, Schneider et al. also pointed to Zimmerman's Empowerment Theory [90]. This framework is geared towards rehabilitation sciences and healthcare, thus particularly suited for HCI studies that relate empowerment to disabled people and assistive technology. Zimmerman et al. distinguish three fundamental components of empowerment in rehabilitation: 1) control and access to resources; 2) participation with others; and 3) critical awareness of the sociopolitical environment. Interestingly, Zimmerman also points out that these three outcomes are to be infuenced at three interdependent levels of analysis: the individual, the organisational, and the community level (see Figure 1). For example, whereas a sense of control at the individual level is geared towards supporting an individual to gain mastery to act, at the community level this is geared towards organisations working together to exert control over policy decisions. Hence, Zimmerman emphasizes the interdependency between the diferent levels, these are not to be separated. Even on an individual level, i.e., psychological empowerment, is defned as the \"knowledge and skills necessary to take efective action within sociopolitical context\" [90]. Relating this back to the dimensions provided by Schneider, this implies that one cannot separate power-over from power-to, these are fundamentally interrelated. Zimmerman also observed that most research on empowerment is devoted to the individual level, yet the organizational and community levels are equally important and deserve equal attention. Moreover, a consequent premise of Zimmerman's framework is that we can only learn about how empowerment in rehabilitation, and by extension in a healthcare context such as a school for disabled children, by studying the specifc settings that provide opportunities as well as the broader socio-cultural context in which it takes place. Empowerment must be conceptualized \"differently for specifc contexts and populations\" [90, p. 4].", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_para_3": "Wearables for teaching and learning that speak about and to the body vary in approaches that support and enable the construction of knowledge.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015). Recently, neural architectures have been shown effective in such a task, whereby minimal feature engineering is required (Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Peters et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Domain adaptation, as a special case for transfer learning, aims to exploit the abundant data of wellstudied source domains to improve the performance in target domains of interest (Pan and Yang, 2010;Weiss et al., 2016). There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain. The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process. Figure 1 illustrates the two approaches based on the BLSTM-CRF (bidirectional LSTM augmented with a CRF layer) architecture for NER.

However, despite significant resources required for training such models, the performance of a model trained on one domain typically degrades dramatically when applied to a different domain, yet extracting entities from new emerging domains such as social media can be of significant interest. In this paper, we empirically investigate effective methods for conveniently adapting an existing, well-trained neural NER model for a new domain. Unlike existing approaches, we propose lightweight yet effective methods for performing domain adaptation for neural models. Specifically, we introduce adaptation layers on top of existing neural architectures, where no re-training using the source domain data is required.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain. Finally, we also perform a thorough investigation of our system performances, providing insights and pinpointing the reasons behind our improvements via a fine-grained evaluation on different label-frequency classes.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_0": "Being able to associate entity mentions in a given text with the correct entity they refer to is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Similarly to SoPa, several recently introduced variants of CNNs support varying window sizes by either allowing several fixed window sizes (Yin and Sch\u00fctze, 2015) or by supporting non-consecutive n-gram matching (Lei et al., 2015;Nguyen and Grishman, 2016).", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_para_8": "All these existing works do not use domainspecific embeddings for different domains and they use the same neural model for source and target models.

Recently, several works introduced simpler versions of RNNs, such as recurrent additive networks (Lee et al., 2017) and Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2017). Like SoPa, these models can be seen as points along the bridge between RNNs and CNNs.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_4": "Neural Module Networks.

Each of these modules are specialized to compute basic reasoning tasks and can be assembled to perform complex and compositional reasoning. (Andreas et al., 2016b) used dependency trees (Zhu et al., 2013) to generate the execution layouts. (Andreas et al., 2016a) proposed dynamic NMNs that learns and adapts the structure of the execution layouts to the question.

IEP model achieves promising performance on CLEVR dataset. (Liu et al., 2019) proposed IEP-Ref by extending IEP model to CLEVR-Ref+ dataset and outperformed all the prior works. Although, compositional by design, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow and fail to ground novel combinations of known linguistic constructs (Bahdanau et al., 2019). The major difference between our work and these prior works of NMN is that we explicitly parametrize and contextualize the neural modules by jointly attending over the visual and textual inputs.

SoPa defines a set of soft patterns of different lengths, with each pattern represented as a WFSA (Section 3). While the number and lengths of the patterns are hyperparameters, the patterns themselves are learned end-to-end.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

Then we select the best 20% using Wang  Results in table 7 show the effectiveness of the mined training data. By referencing previous results (Edunov et al., 2018), we see that the model using the en-de mined data yields performance that is only 2.8 BLEU away from performance of the best system that made use of the official WMT17 en-de parallel data. Compare to prior en-zh results (Sennrich et al., 2017), we see that our model using mined en-zh training data is as good as a WMT17 NMT model that is trained on the official WMT en-zh parallel data.

There have been several proposals to alleviate this issue with, for instance, self-supervised learning techniques, but they still require human-annotated corpora. In this work, we explore the unsupervised learning paradigm which can potentially work with unlabeled text corpora that are cheaper and easier to obtain. Our model builds upon the recent work on Noisy Student Training, a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the idea of self-training. Experimental results on the commonly used English Switchboard test set show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art supervised systems using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. BERT and ELECTRA).", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_metadata": "Authors: \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Sungjin Ahn, Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_metadata": "Authors: Min-Hsuan Yeh, Lun-Wei Ku | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks.

We use the French Treebank from the SPMRL 2014 shared task (Seddah et al., 2014) with its provided splits for our French experiments. No token preprocessing is performed, and only a single <UNK> token is used for unknown words at test time. The inputs to our system are concatenations of 100-dimensional word embeddings and 50-dimensional part-of-speech embeddings. In the case of the French Treebank, we also include 50-dimensional embeddings of each morphological tag. We use automatically predicted tags for training and testing, obtaining predicted part-ofspeech tags for the Penn Treebank using the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) with 10-way jackknifing, and using the provided predicted partof-speech and morphological tags for the French Treebank.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_metadata": "Authors: Jennifer G.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

Word-level F1, commonly used in the Machine Comprehension and ConvQA tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018Choi et al., 2018), evaluates the word overlap between the system's prediction and the ground truth answer span. Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1. Given n references (ground-truth answers) for each question, human F1 is calculated by averaging the maximum F1 from each n\u22121 subset with respect to the heldout reference (Choi et al., 2018). This metric is composed of HEQ-Q, computed at the question level, and HEQ-D, computed at the dialogue (conversation) level.

While response quality directly assesses the quality of user responses to an interview question, the level of user engagement quantifies how much a participant is engaged with a chatbot from multiple aspects (e.g., how long an engagement is)."}}

There have been several proposals to alleviate this issue with, for instance, self-supervised learning techniques, but they still require human-annotated corpora.

Our model builds upon the recent work on Noisy Student Training, a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the idea of self-training. Experimental results on the commonly used English Switchboard test set show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art supervised systems using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. BERT and ELECTRA).", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_2": "Most work on disfluency detection focus on supervised learning methods, which mainly fall into three main categories: sequence tagging, noisy-channel, and parsing-based approaches. Sequence tagging approaches label words as fluent or disfluent using a variety of different techniques, including conditional random fields (CRF) (Georgila, 2009;Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014), Max-Margin Markov Networks (M 3 N) (Qian and Liu, 2013), Semi-Markov CRF (Ferguson et al., 2015), and recurrent neural networks (Hough and Schlangen, 2015;Zayats et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016). The main benefit of sequential models is the ability to capture longterm relationships between reparandum and repairs. Noisy channel models (Charniak and Johnson, 2001;Johnson and Charniak, 2004;Zwarts et al., 2010;Lou and Johnson, 2017) use the similarity between reparandum and repair as an indicator of disfluency. Parsing-based approaches (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013;Honnibal and Johnson, 2014;Wu et al., 2015;Yoshikawa et al., 2016;Jamshid Lou et al., 2019) jointly perform parsing and disfluency detection. The joint models can capture long-range dependency of disfluencies as well as chunk-level information.

Following Honnibal and Johnson (2014), we lower-case the text and remove all punctuations and partial words. 2 We also discard the 'um' and 'uh' tokens and merge 'you know' and 'i mean' into single tokens.", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_abstract": "The paper presents a first attempt towards unsupervised neural text simplification that relies only on unlabeled text corpora.

We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the French Treebank (82.23 F1).", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_5": "We also compare our approach with existing supervised and unsupervised lexical simplifications like LIGHTLS (Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), Neural Text Simplification or NTS (Nisioi et al., 2017), Syntax based Machine Translation or SBMT (Xu    PBSMT (Wubben et al., 2012).

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources.

We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex.

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_para_0": "When reading text, humans make commonsense inferences that frame their understanding of the narrative being presented.

In this work, we cast commonsense acquisition as knowledge base construction and investigate whether large-scale language models can effectively learn to generate the knowledge  necessary to automatically construct a commonsense knowledge base (KB). Automatic KB construction is a long-standing goal of artificial intelligence research due to the difficulty of achieving high concept coverage in high-precision curated KBs (Lenat, 1995;Miller, 1995). Previous work has developed models capable of reading and extracting semi-structured text (Suchanek et al., 2007;Hoffart et al., 2013;Auer et al., 2007;Bollacker et al., 2008) and unstructured text (Dong et al., 2014;Carlson et al., 2010;Nakashole et al., 2011Nakashole et al., , 2012Niu, 2012) into relational schemas that can be queried for downstream applications.

Somewhat more similar to ours is work like Elazar et al. (2021), which explores the consistency of models' generation of facts in the face of rephrasing of prompts.

It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text.

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_5": "To evaluate our interpretation technique on real world data, we applied our method on four trained models over two tasks: recognizing textual entailment using the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference corpus (Williams et al., 2018) and named entity recognition using the CoNLL 2003 data (Sang and Meulder, 2003) for English NER.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

These approaches leverage a cross-translation method on a multilingual NMT model where for a parallel data pair (S x ,S y ), they translate S x into language Z with the current model to get S z . Then use (S y ,S z ) as an additional synthesized data pair to further improve the model. Garcia et al.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 screen reader users to understand their preferences for various styles of profile picture image descriptions in different social contexts. We also interviewed seven sighted individuals to explore their thoughts on authoring alt text for profile pictures.

The focus of our work was to expand our understanding of how the appearance of profle pictures within diferent contexts infuences the information needs of screen reader users, ultimately so that applications and platforms can provide relevant image descriptions when and how users want them. Also, by understanding the misconceptions sighted individuals have regarding profle picture alt text, we can think about how to prompt users to author descriptions that meet the needs of screen reader users. In this section, we discuss the role of profle pictures as a form of identity representation; how context infuenced information needs; the disjointed image description experiences between screen reader and sighted users; the potential of narrated image descriptions; and the unique image description challenges posed by avatars.", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_para_7": "We found that our sighted participants were often unsure about what should be included in image descriptions, and frequently questioned the importance of various details.

Overall, the tendency was for our sighted participants to suggest that less information be provided. An issue at play is that our sighted participants' views on what should be included in image descriptions were typically based on their personal opinions, not on what they thought might be useful to screen reader users. Mismatches between screen reader and sighted users is an example of Problem 1 of \"Why CSCW applications fail\" presented by Grudin [11]: the disparity between who does the work and who gets the beneft. This problem is often exacerbated in accessibility contexts since the people who do the work often do not understand the needs or perspectives of the people who will beneft.

For example, touch input remains largely inaccessible to people with motor impairments who need to adopt workaround strategies to be able to access content on touchscreen devices [4,37] and who need specific touch interaction techniques [40]. We also know from the literature of touch interaction for children that small children between 3 and 6 years old experience difficulties with touch and multitouch input [67] and that the touch gestures of children between 7 and 10 years old are recognized with lower accuracy rates than the same gestures produced by adults [3].

However, generic web search poses two problems. First, search is blind to relevant contextual information that could connect users to better resources [13,14,26]. Search engines place the burden on users to articulate an appropriate query, an almost paradoxical requirement for users who are there because they don't know the domain [44].

We focus on video assistance because despite video's growing popularity (Cisco predicts that by 2021, 82% of all internet traffic will be video [2]), searching and browsing video remain cumbersome [25,39,40]. Video is popular for content creators as it is often easier to author than tutorials or diagrams (which require careful curation).

Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

However, people frequently lack valuable knowledge about at least one application, especially as software changes and new software emerges. Existing help systems either lack contextual knowledge or are tightly-knit into a single application. We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources and demonstrate it through the RePlay system. RePlay uses accessibility APIs to gather context about the user's activity. It leverages an existing search engine to present relevant videos and highlights key segments within them using video captions. We report on a week-long field study (n=7) and a lab study (n=24) showing that contextual assistance helps people spend less time away from their task than web video search and replaces current video navigation strategies.

However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_1": "Regarding the overall satisfaction with the platform, 25 subjects participated in a post-experiment online survey.

We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C).

Ekman and Friesen (1969) proposed two categories of cues: deception cues and leakage cues. Deception cues relate to the content of lies, such as an inconsistency in one's story; leakage cues appear because liars' emotions betray their true feeling, which can be further classified into non-verbal and verbal leakage cues. Zuckerman et al. (1981) reject the utility of focusing on liars' emotions but link such cues to cognitive load, supported by Vrij et al. (2008Vrij et al. ( , 2016Vrij et al. ( , 2017. DePaulo et al. (2003) analyzes 158 cues to deception, including non-verbal and verbal leakage cues, finding that verbal leakage cues are more reliable than others. Studies such as Adams (1996), Smith (2001), and Levitan (2019) show that verbal leak-age cues can be found through psycholinguistic dictionaries such as the LIWC lexicon (Pennebaker et al., 1999), LDI (Bachenko et al., 2008;Enos, 2009), and Harbingers (Niculae et al., 2015).", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_abstract": "Although many studies use the LIWC lexicon to show the existence of verbal leakage cues in lie detection datasets, none mention how verbal leakage cues are influenced by means of data collection, or the impact thereof on the performance of models. In this paper, we study verbal leakage cues to understand the effect of the data construction method on their significance, and examine the relationship between such cues and models\u2019 validity. The LIWC word-category dominance scores of seven lie detection datasets are used to show that audio statements and lie-based annotations indicate a greater number of strong verbal leakage cue categories. Moreover, we evaluate the validity of state-of-the-art lie detection models with cross- and in-dataset testing. Results show that in both types of testing, models trained on a dataset with more strong verbal leakage cue categories\u2014as opposed to only a greater number of strong cues\u2014yield superior results, suggesting that verbal leakage cues are a key factor for selecting lie detection datasets.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A

On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2.

Then word alignment is used to find mappings between source and target words, so that source syntactic dependencies can be projected to the target translations. Following, a postprocessing step is applied by removing unaligned target words, in order to ensure that the resulting target syntax forms a valid dependency tree, The method has shown promising performance for unsupervised cross-lingual dependency parsing among transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011;T\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et al., 2012;Rasooli and Collins, 2015;Guo et al., 2016b). * Corresponding author.  The treebank translation method, however, suffers from various sources of noise. For example, machine translation errors directly affect the resulting treebank, by introducing ungrammatical word sequences. In addition, the alignments between source and target words may not be isomorphic due to inherent differences between languages or paraphrasing during translation. For example, in the case of Figure 1, the English words \"are\" and \"being\", and the Swedish word \"med\", do not have corresponding word-level translation. In addition, it can be perfect to express \"as soon as they can\" using \"very quickly\" in a translation, which looses word alignment information because of the longer span. Finally, errors in automatic word alignments can also bring noise.

Coding, a typically indoor, screen-based activity, can potentially enrich outdoor play, serving as a rule-making medium. We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device, enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas, coding them, and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study, 24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones, enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements, integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code, and were excited to see their code come to life.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

between experts, suggesting that the current annotation task needs a better definition. This paper proposes a new multi-axis modeling to better capture the temporal structure of events. In addition, we identify that event end-points are a major source of confusion in annotation, so we also propose to annotate TempRels based on start-points only. A pilot expert annotation effort using the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in IAA from the conventional 60\u2019s to 80\u2019s (Cohen\u2019s Kappa). This better-defined annotation scheme further enables the use of crowdsourcing to alleviate the labor intensity for each annotator.

work from Correll & Heer [7] suggests that people are able to perform a general sort of \"regression by eye\" with simple Gaussian stimuli and a single class of outliers. However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

For instance, the IAAs of TB-Dense, RED and THYME-TimeML (Styler IV et al., 2014) were only below or near 60% (given that events are already annotated). Since a low IAA usually indicates that the task is difficult even for humans (see Examples 1-3), the community has been looking into ways to simplify the task, by reducing the label set, and by breaking up the overall, complex task into subtasks (e.g., getting agreement on which event pairs should have a relation, and then what that relation should be) (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016;O'Gorman et al., 2016). In contrast to other existing datasets, Bethard et al. (2007) achieved an agreement as high as 90%, but the scope of its annotation was narrowed down to a very special verb-clause structure."}}

However, people frequently lack valuable knowledge about at least one application, especially as software changes and new software emerges. Existing help systems either lack contextual knowledge or are tightly-knit into a single application. We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources and demonstrate it through the RePlay system. RePlay uses accessibility APIs to gather context about the user's activity. It leverages an existing search engine to present relevant videos and highlights key segments within them using video captions. We report on a week-long field study (n=7) and a lab study (n=24) showing that contextual assistance helps people spend less time away from their task than web video search and replaces current video navigation strategies. Our findings highlight challenges with representing and using context across applications.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_5": "Bringing learning resources directly into applications reduces the need for context switching. For example, proactively recommending content in-situ based on user context can lead users to resources they might not have even thought to search for [11,16,23,32,35]. In-app search also helps users stay focused on their task while learning [11,16,28]. RePlay brings these strategies into an application-independent system, functioning alongside the user's applications.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_10": "RePlay's main insight is that given a source of user context, we can search, curate, and index into resources from a large corpus. RePlay demonstrates this approach using video; different activities (e.g., programming) may benefit from other types of content (e.g., text resources). RePlay could naturally be extended to any textual content (or content with textual metadata). Text results could be displayed as short summaries with clickable keywords to expand more detail [13]. For detecting context, RePlay used MacOS's accessibility api; other oss (e.g. Windows [34]) also have similar apis. Beyond software, RePlay's approach could extend to any domain for which online videos are abundant (e.g., physical building tasks). To detect activity context, one could augment physical tools with sensors [31,46] or track body poses with wearable sensors or computer vision. A challenge for future work is to convert sensor or vision data into text searches, or to index videos using the sensor or vision data directly.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_2": "We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources. We embody this approach in the RePlay system, which enables users to search for learning videos based on their application usage. RePlay gathers application context using system accessibility apis. It extends online video search and cues videos to relevant segments based on their captions. We focus on video assistance because despite video's growing popularity (Cisco predicts that by 2021, 82% of all internet traffic will be video [2]), searching and browsing video remain cumbersome [25,39,40]. Video is popular for content creators as it is often easier to author than tutorials or diagrams (which require careful curation). Learners value video for its efficacy in communicating complex or continuous visual actions such as brushing or setting parameters [10]. However, interacting with videos remains difficult because they are harder to navigate and scan for steps than text [10].", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_4": "The most teachable moment for software tasks is often when the user is actively working... but stuck. In-task help for a specific goal is one of the biggest reasons people seek web [27] and video [4] tutorials. However, tutorials tend to show a full task from start to finish, much of which may not be relevant to the user's current goal. This leaves it to the user to both find a relevant tutorial and locate the segment(s) within it that contains the needed information. Effectively searching the Web is an acquired skill; coming up with the right keywords and search settings can be difficult, especially for novices [44]. In addition, web search environments lack context that human tutors use to proactively offer help and tailor feedback [45]. Adding contextual terms automatically to search queries (e.g., os version, application, recently-used tools) can help improve the relevance and utility of search results without requiring the user to know app-specific terminology [7,13,33]. RePlay augments queries with the current application name and uses context from both the current and recently-used applications to support cross-app activities when ranking search results.", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_9": "Finding clips and re-ranking videos.

Alternatively, computer vision can detect tool-selection events [32,41], even without prior knowledge about the specific software [5]. To be application-independent and embed online videos directly without waiting to download and process them, RePlay instead uses metadata and caption text to rank and segment videos.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

We observed statistically significant differences for most of the GREAT measures, marked with an asterisk in Figure 4 F (2,177) >4, p<.001, \u03b7 2 p <0.2 . Post-hoc tests revealed that gestures produced by people with visual impairments were less accurate than those produced by people without visual impairments (p < .01). However, we found no significant difference between gestures produced by people with visual impairments and synthesized gestures (p > .05, n.s.).

The essence of outdoor play is \"heads up\" social interaction and physical activity [11,16,31,43], which are not natural characteristics of coding activities. Moreover, adding screens to outdoor play (a coding platform running on a tablet device) is thought to interfere with natural play patterns [34] and compromise the benefits of natural play [44]. Nonetheless, the children successfully bridged this gap, using the \"heads down\" coding activity to create code that generates a \"heads up\" outdoor game experience. In addition, children played their games with their friends with no further adjustments to the code, indicating that they were able to program playable outdoor games. This may be attributed to the clear distinction between the coding platform and the digital device, that framed the coding platform as a tool for defining the game and the device as a tool for playing the game. Future work should test this assumption and compare the digital coding platform to a more tangible coding platform.

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch).

We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_3": "To address the limitations of the 2D touch interaction space, researchers have investigated possible alternative interaction space above, around, and on the back of the devices.

SideSwipe [35] also leverages the unmodified global system for mobile communication (GSM) signal to enable in-air hand gestures above and at the side of a mobile device. Arefin Shimon et. al., [1] explored hand gestures above a smartwatch in order to overcome the limited interaction space of the small screen.

However, expanding the interaction space beyond the touchscreen may sacrifice some of the benefits of direct-touch interactions (e.g., increased time for selecting a target and better performance in pointing tasks [16]).

Similarly, Finger-Aware Shortcuts [36] employed finger, hand, and posture identification for keyboards to provide shortcut availability and expressivity. In this system, a key press can have multiple command mappings depending on which fingers and postures were used to press a key. Jackson et. al. [15] also extend multi-touch interfaces by using a combination of multi-touch gestures and 3D movements of the hand(s) above the surface. Furthermore, Kim et al. [18] and Song et al. [27] augmented touch events on mobile devices with finger gestures by using both hands. One hand controls a touch device, while the other hand performs gestures as an additional input. Conversely, Hinckley et. al. [13] explored interaction techniques with one hand for hand-held devices that leverage the combination of touch and motion, suggesting hybrid touch+motion gestures. In addition, Expressy [33], using only one hand, employed the movement of the wrist to add expressiveness to touch-based interactions. Air+Touch [5] focused on in-air gestures performed only with the thumb to enhance touch interaction while the same hand grasped the phone.

This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis.

We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques.", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_para_1": "An example of operating close to 3D content is when Hachet et al.

Finegrained analyses of users' gesture articulations are also possible to understand how users vary their gestures relative to each other and relative to recognizers' canonical template forms [65,66]. Also, gesture recognition algorithms have been using many gesture features, such as path length, articulation time, or average speed [8,52], that can be repurposed as gesture performance measures to evaluate users' gesture articulations [51,68].

Participants can display their engagement or disengagement, for example, by altering their gaze orientations or bodily positions and confgurations. However, even when displaying disengagement, participants do not ignore copresent others. Instead, they closely monitor others' actions, as the state of co-presence continuously proposes the relevance of a collaborative activity such as talk [28].

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification.

This context leads to multiple challenges that range from exploiting restricted, small and mostly unlabeled datasets to finding and adapting methods for such context. We tackle these challenges by using Few-Shot Learning while making the hypothesis it can serve conversational emotion classification for different languages and sparse labels. We contribute by proposing a variation of Prototypical Networks for sequence labeling in conversation that we name ProtoSeq.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches.

More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019).

The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates.

Although this is effective for stimulation of vision and hearing (senses with relatively small sensing organs), it is much more difficult problem to stimulate the surface of the skin, the largest organ on the human body [8].

We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4].

Information from the senses are integrated in the brain to form plausible (internally consistent) representation of own body [24]. It has been revealed that the multisensory integration process can be manipulated to create altered perception of the self. One of the earliest experiments demonstrating malleability of the bodily representation is known as the rubber hand illusion [6]. In the rubber hand illusion, simultaneous haptic stimulation of a participant's hand (hidden behind a screen) and a rubber hand placed ahead of the participant (in a natural resting position) leads to rising of feelings that the rubber hand is actually part of the participant's body, and the tactile sensations seem to be originating in the rubber hand.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_abstract": "Neurophysiological laboratory studies are often constraint to immediate geographical surroundings and access to equipment may be temporally restricted.

Tactile perception is largely dependent on the integration of information from multiple senses. This is in line with the study discovering that observing a video with a hand being touched during the reception of tactile stimuli on own hand enhances the sensory threshold [53]. Moreover, just observing touch on other human body can be 'felt'. In [28], it was found that touch observation activates the somatosensory areas in the brain. Indeed, humans posses such 'tactile empathy' that allows them to experience illusory tactile sensations while seeing other persons being touched.

For example, Wall++ [59] uses conductive paint for patterning large electrodes onto a wall, turning ordinary walls into smart infrastructure supporting capacitive touch tracking. TouchLight [45] presents a touch screen display system on a sheet of acrylic plastic by instrumenting two video cameras behind the semi-transparent plane.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_abstract": "In this work we introduce peripheral awareness as a neurological state for real-time human-computer integration, where the human is assisted by a computer to interact with the world.

On the other hand, we found a high variation of daily accuracies within subjects. The consumer-grade EEG and our fitting algorithm allowed subjects to record neural data quickly, but the hardware may also pose new challenges for the BCI user: Even when perfectly fitted, the dry sensors at distant ends of the scalp may require users to induce strong, consistent modulations in neural activity in order to be reliably detected. As one potential mediator, meditation experience may affect the ability to maintain focus in unsupervised environments [27]. However, in a post-hoc analysis, we found that self-reported meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies in this study. On the other hand, daily motivational scores correlate positively with accuracy in this study. Therefore, using the MYND platform to combine easily accessible control strategies with motivating, daily feedback could further improve performance and help with more consistent execution. This feedback will need to be robust to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and higher susceptibility to involuntary head-muscle artifacts around the ears and the forehead, where the sensors are located. As one promising approach to implement robust feedback, concurrent work in [28] explored an adaptive signal-filtering method that relies on signal-variation, similar to the fitting algorithm presented here.

It was found that thinking about positive memories increases activity in the alpha-band, while mental calculations decrease activity. Similarly, the \"Music imagery\" strategy instructs subjects to switch between playing their favorite song in their head or consecutively subtract a small number from a larger number, which has also been found to modulate parietal alpha-activity [33], [4]. Self-referential thoughts have shown to modulate activity in the theta-(3-7 Hz) alpha-(8-13 Hz) and beta-bands (17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30) of the human EEG [34], [35].

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Much research Session 7: Sensing in the Small Scale UIST 2018, October 14-17, 2018, Berlin, Germany has been conducted on using the back of a mobile device [26] or handheld device [34] as a possible input space. This extended space enables a variety of multi-finger gestures beyond the touchscreen, providing far richer interactions. However, expanding the interaction space beyond the touchscreen may sacrifice some of the benefits of direct-touch interactions (e.g., increased time for selecting a target and better performance in pointing tasks [16]). Therefore, we seek to combine touch and in-air gestures to maximize the benefits of modality and expressivity.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_9": "As demonstrated in prior work [5,11,13,23], our technique shows that the tap with a \"Spread\" hand pose can activate the touch for selecting a file, while the tap with a \"Spread All\"", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_abstract": "In this paper, we present Touch+Finger, a new interaction technique that augments touch input with multi-finger gestures for rich and expressive interaction. The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \"idle\" fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_metadata": "Authors: B.

Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors.

We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50.

At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_metadata": "Authors: Shoaib Jameel, S.

This isotropy property is convenient for studying word embeddings from a theoretical point of view (Arora et al., 2016), but it sits at odds with fact that words can be organised in various natural groupings. For instance, we might perhaps expect that words from the same part-of-speech class should be clustered together in the word embedding. Similarly, we might expect that organising word vectors in clusters that represent semantic themes would also be beneficial. In fact, a number of approaches have already been proposed that use external knowledge for imposing such a cluster structure, capturing the intuition that words which belong to the same category should be represented by similar vectors (Xu et al., 2014;Guo et al., 2015;Hu et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016c) or be located in a low-dimensional subspace (Jameel and Schockaert, 2016).

These assignments are then used to learn vector representations of words and topics.

In traditional topic models such as LDA, the topics are typically labelled by the k words that have the highest probability in the topic. These words tend to reflect semantically coherent themes, which is an important reason for the popularity of topic models. Accordingly, measuring the coherence of the top-k words that are identified by a given topic model, for each topic, is a common evaluation measure (Shi et al., 2017). Using the configurations that performed best on the tuning data in the document categorization task above, we used Gensim 27 (\u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek  and Sojka, 2010) to compute the coherence of the top-20 words using the c v metric (R\u00f6der et al., 2015). For our model, GDLA and sHDP, the mixture components that were learned were consided as topics for this experiment. For GloVe, WeMAP, SG, TF-IDF, and CBOW, we used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) soft clustering model (Banerjee et al., 2005) to determine the cluster memberships of the context words. For the TF-IDF results, we instead used hard vMF clustering (Hornik and Gr\u00fcn, 2014), as the movMF results are based on TF-IDF features as well. We tuned the number of clusters using the tuning data. The top-20 words after applying the clustering model were then output based on the distance from the cluster centroid. The results are shown in Table 9, showing that the word clusters defined by our mixture components are more semantically coherent than the topics obtained by the other methods.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_para_6": "Convolutional neural networks.

We show that the type of smartphone-based activity and the interactional context afect the way in which a particular instance of smartphone use is designed and oriented to by other participants. Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75]. By analyzing naturally occurring interactions, this study seeks to identify issues with existing defnitions of phubbing and ofers a new conceptualization for future research. As this study also investigates participants' practices of returning smartphone users back into conversations, we conclude the paper with design implications, aiming to support participants' practices for dealing with extended smartphone use.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_metadata": "Authors: B.

Recent studies have shown that mobile technology use is embedded in various everyday activities [8,49,74,79]. Consequently, researchers have raised concerns about the negative efects of pervasive smartphone use on the quality of face-to-face interactions [2,20,80], hence the term phubbing (phone snubbing), which refers to situations when co-present others are overshadowed by smartphone use. So far, most of the existing studies on smartphone use have been based on surveys, interviews, or data collected in experimental settings. One problem with these approaches is that they often fail to take the interactional context of smartphone use into account. The generalizability of much-published research on this issue is also problematic, as the mainstream approaches do not consider when, how, and by whom smartphone use is initiated (i.e., its communicational motivation) and how co-present others then react to this. The necessity to analyze smartphone use in real-life contexts has been recently emphasized [15,37], but relatively few studies have focused on smartphone use in natural communication settings [21,53,71].", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_metadata": "Authors: Alexander J.

However, most of these studies are quantitative in nature and fail to grasp the interactional context of smartphone use. Drawing on video recordings and utilizing multimodal interaction analysis, the present study examines phubbing in naturally occurring interactions among young adults. Contrary to most previous research, the analysis reveals that disengagement often precedes self-initiated smartphone use rather than follows it. The study identifies factors that affect whether phubbing is reciprocated and whether it is oriented to as problematic. As a result of the analysis, an alternative conceptualization of phubbing is offered. By reflecting on participants\u2019 ways of managing phubbing and its consequences, we discuss design solutions for supporting them in this task.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_3": "The concept of phubbing is now widely used in studies aiming to understand how smartphone use afects face-to-face interactions [2,12,13,65,66,87]. Phubbing has been studied in a variety of different settings and types of relationships: professional settings [7], family interactions [7,42], and interactions with romantic partners [7,24,34,56], with friends and acquaintances [2], and even with virtual agents [68]. Despite the diferences in context, phubbing is defned quite similarly in these studies and usually consists of two parts: (1) ignoring co-present other(s) and (2) focusing on the mobile device instead. Prior studies have reported that smartphone-based multitasking (e.g., texting during face-to-face interactions) leads to lower romantic intimacy with partners [6], lower conversation intimacy [59,76,87], a decrease in the level of perceived quality of relationships [34,56], and a lower level of perceived interaction quality [13,86]. Phubbing is also associated with individuals experiencing a sense of social exclusion [17]. In light of the growing number of studies on this topic, several literature reviews have been conducted to summarize fndings about various phubbing practices and their predictors and impacts [5,11]. While some researchers claim that phubbing has become a social norm [12], other scholars argue that it has not yet become a normative practice despite being widespread [2]. It is also paradoxical that survey participants often admit to using technology in interactions with others, while also claiming that such behavior is ofensive and negatively impacts interpersonal interactions [2,7]. In part, these discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that most phubbing research uses quantitative methods, and the most frequent data collection instrument is a questionnaire [11], which often disregards the interactional context of device use. More recent studies underline the importance of studying phubbing in the context of participants' daily environments. It has been shown that phubbing behavior can be assessed diferently by the phubbee (the person receiving phubbing) depending on the context: phubbing does not damage relationships on its own, but the negative impact of phubbing is attributed to negative appraisals, which can vary across diferent situations [24]. There are, however, relatively few studies that analyze actual instances of solitary smartphone use in naturally occurring interactions [52,70]. In this study, we therefore attempt to understand phubbing as it unfolds in real-life situations. However, phubbing must frst be deconstructed and reinterpreted through the lens of interaction analysis, which is done in the next subsection.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_metadata": "Authors: Kiel S.

Most existing studies in this area use quantitative methods that do not take interactional context into account [11], and it has been recently suggested that smartphone use should be analyzed in the context of participants' daily environments [24,52,87]. While prior HCI studies have elucidated many important aspects of collaborative smartphone use [8-10, 74, 75], self-initiated individual smartphone use has received much less attention. This study contributes to the body of HCI literature by uncovering and describing common patterns of individual smartphone use in everyday co-present interactions. Our fndings demonstrate when and how young adults themselves initiate, carry out, and terminate individual smartphone use when interacting with others. Below, we summarize the key fndings, situate them within previous research and present implications for HCI. We discuss the role of context in the way smartphone use is initiated, factors afecting whether smartphone use is carried out as a temporarily prioritized or as a parallel activity, reasons for reciprocating one's smartphone use and participants' strategies for managing extended smartphone use. The analysis of naturally occurring interactions also allows us to respecify phubbing and suggest guidelines for further research. Drawing on participants' practices of managing extended smartphone use, we propose how the design of mobile technologies can better facilitate social interactions. Finally, we discuss limitations of this study and directions for future research.", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_metadata": "Authors: J.

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis. We adopt a sensor fusion approach by taking both 'surface waves' (i.e., vibrations through surface) and 'sound waves' (i.e., vibrations through air) into analysis to improve sensing resolution. We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_8": "Many passive acoustic approaches have been employed to detect gestures [12,20,21,52] and localize signals [17,24,36,37,48,49].

When a Ping-Pong ball falls inside of this region, the signal arrives to the four sensors at different times, enabling a hyperbolic intersection localization.

Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20]. Nonetheless, our techniques require wearing multiple rings to track the motions of secondary fingers, which may be somewhat impractical for some users. This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements. For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_metadata": "Authors: Jiapeng Wang, Lianwen Jin, Kai Ding | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_8": "To track the motion of secondary fingers in the air, the ring-like device prototypes were worn on the thumb and the index finger. We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_metadata": "Authors: Tingting Liu, Xiaotong Li, Chen Bao, M.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_7": "In order to implement Touch+Finger gestures as new interaction techniques, it is necessary to track the motions of fingers in the air. Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

This can be achieved without any modification of objects or the environment. For this, we used a highly directional pan-tilt ultrasonic array. By modulating a 40 kHz ultrasonic signal, we can emit sound that is inaudible \"in flight\" and demodulates to audible frequencies when impacting a surface through acoustic parametric interaction. This makes it appear as though the sound originates from an object and not the speaker.

To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_metadata": "Authors: Orestis Papakyriakopoulos, Severin Engelmann, Amy Winecoff | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_abstract": "We demonstrate a program that learns to pronounce Chinese text in Mandarin, without a pronunciation dictionary.

A study of online conversations during the Zika epidemic highlighted the challenges citizens faced with authoritative risk information and the countermeasures they took to fnd trustworthy guidance for their decision-making [46]. The extreme uncertainty of the Zika epidemic gave rise to multidimensional and speculative risk perceptions, highlighting the need for a more participatory approach to risk communication that engages laypeople/members of the public along with experts [47].

Research in the feld of risk communication has argued for almost two decades that providing users with information about the degree and source of uncertainty in forecast models improves their trust in information sources and supports decision-making [88].

In this paper we provide an overview of an initial research agenda for HCI that focuses on communicating risk information to the public during the predictive phase of storms. As HCI research in this space continues to develop, we anticipate that further opportunities will develop and that we may also take on related questions, such as risk communications focused primarily in urban and regional planning decisions aimed at mitigating storm risk, rather than taking protective action in the lead-up period.

First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties. Thus, there is much opportunity for HCI and information visualization research to continue studying efective methods for uncertainty visualization approaches for hurricane forecasts [20] [105] [109] [113] [133].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_11": "HCI has already contributed important fndings to understanding how people share visual imagery of storm impacts on social media, including the importance of contextualization to one's local area and of representing uncertainty [11]. These fndings may be built upon further through augmented or virtual reality techniques that have been experimented with in science education and visualizations about climate change and disaster [10]. The Weather Channel has also used these tools to communicate disaster risk to the public [56]. AR/VR tools have also been used by HCI research into science education [106]. Such approaches ofer the potential to deliver contextualized risk information to the public in ways that includes familiar local landmarks and settings, which is thought to improve user understanding and trust. Finally, including information about vulnerable communities or public resources is another tactic that may be useful. Communication of vulnerability ahead of storm arrival could provide additional information to users about potential impacts of the storm in ways that support decision-making or improved understanding of hurricane risk.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_13": "Much of the discussion about uncertainty in science and risk communication treats uncertainty as problematic, or as a challenge to be overcome [119]. Hence there is intense focus on identifying and reducing sources of uncertainty in risk models and developing efective means of communicating the remainder. While such eforts are no doubt essential, there are several strands of work in HCI that explore the benefts of engaging with uncertainty. Research in the area of ambiguous design, for example, has argued that purposeful inclusion of ambiguity can support deeper appropriation of complex technologies by users [42]. Game design rests on careful use of uncertainty to create tension, challenge, and engagement from participants [25]. Prior crisis informatics research in food risk visualization has explored the role of serious games and deliberative risk communication strategies to support deeper understanding of complex information about disaster [116].

For example, research has shown that graphics are more efective at communicating risk than text products, yet members of the public often have trouble interpreting commonly used graphics used to describe hurricane projections [26] [96] [105]. In addition, ofcial information created and disseminated by hurricane experts at NOAA or local emergency management ofces is increasingly competing for the public's attention with other sources of information including mainstream and social media and information received from neighbors, friends, and family-members. Another challenge is that many contextual factors, including prior experience with storms, socioeconomic status, and behaviors of an individual's social networks, infuence people's decisions to prepare, evacuate, or take other protective actions prior to storms [15] [32].

First, research in disaster risk communication has identifed important diferences in information-seeking behavior needs between disabled and non-disabled user groups [120]. For example, one study has found that hearing-impaired persons rely most on friends and family for hurricane risk information, while non-hearing-impaired persons with disabilities rely on television sources more than internet sources [72]. At present, most risk information sources available to the public are not geared towards people with disabilities [101], which can result in a lack of targeted services and assistance to these users [128]. HCI has a strong tradition of research in the area of accessibility that stands to contribute to developing a more robust understanding of how hurricane risk information design can better meet the needs of people with disabilities. Recent work in this feld suggests that such investigations would be best accomplished through extended and iterative collaboration with people with disabilities [8].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_9": "The signifcant amount of expertise that is utilized by forecasters to model and project hurricane threat and impacts can create the impression that the information they produce is somehow neutral or merely technical in nature. Indeed, prior work has demonstrated that risk information can \"hide the basic normative questions essential to ... decision-making in the mystique of statistics\" [39]. One efect of this is to create a counterproductive hierarchy between experts and the local knowledge and lived experiences of at-risk communities [2] [58] [75]. However, any efort to quantify complex phenomena such as the potential impact of storms on local communities will necessarily involve judgment calls and value-laden decisions [118]. These concerns align with work in HCI and critical data studies that seek to unpack and mitigate the various ways in which data standards, algorithms, and other socio-technical processes contain biases and assumptions that refect the interest and worldviews of those who create them, simultaneously excluding and marginalizing other perspectives [9] [43] [62] [63] [94]. Risk communication is often conceived of as a process whereby experts, such as forecasters and meteorologists, transfer knowledge about potential threats to the public for their response [4] [30]. This one-way communication, referred to variously as the broadcast, defcit, or transmission model, has come under scrutiny from various directions, but is still largely characteristic of many risk communication processes [30] [114]. Critiques of these approaches argue that science and risk-intensive protective action design problems are inherently interdisciplinary and require more knowledge than any single person or discipline possesses [3] and that knowledge relevant to hurricane risk is distributed among residents of afected areas as much as scientists and other experts. New insights, ideas, and methods for communicating and activating hurricane risk information will arise by bringing diferent, even contested, points of view together to create a shared or at least collective understanding among those participants of a hurricane decision-making process. Risk-informed decision-making should be conceived of as a series of personal interactions with information tools and artifacts mediated by familiar groups of people and knowledge communities [3]. New technologies, artifacts, workfows, and participatory processes should aford those exposed to hurricane risk to contribute to the framing and resolving the complex problem of risk communication and protective action.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_7": "Many of the central challenges of tropical storm risk communication stem from the gulf of understanding between expert knowledge about storms and popular mental models surrounding risk and uncertainty [15]. Bridging that gulf requires, at minimum, greater understanding of the public's knowledge and beliefs about these topics and may require thinking diferently about how risk models are currently constructed. A standard expert view about forecasts is the notion that a good or efective model is one that is a good predictor -where model outputs accurately match an empirical dataset [110]. However, the usefulness of a weather model for decision-making, is not guaranteed by a good empirical match [7] [66] [78] [95]. On this point Norton [93] argues that models used for decision support must help policymakers and the public to formulate and measure goals efectively, as well as propose and implement plans and policies to reach these goals. Even accurate model predictions may be miscommunicated or misused, resulting in undesirable outcomes [51]. Similarly, the output of a forecast can be efectively communicated, but may not be of a form useful to stakeholders within their specifc decision context. The diferences between expert understanding and the public's needs for hurricane risk information thus creates signifcant challenges for communicating storm risk. The cone of uncertainty, one of the more common hurricane information products [15], exemplifes some of the challenges of risk communication. Pictured in Figure 1, the cone graphic shows the probable path of the storm center over time. The cone in the image delineates the boundaries enclosing two-thirds of modeled tracks based on historical data; thus, there is estimated a 66% chance that the center for the storm will be within the cone during the projected time frame [87]. The cone shape depicts a narrow range of possible storm track boundaries in the more immediate forecast, which expands into a greater range due to increased uncertainty of the track forecast further into the future. Prior work in risk communications has found that the public frequently misinterprets these images in a number of ways, including believing the size of the cone to represent hurricane intensity or that areas outside of the cone were out of the danger area [19] [109]. An alternative to the cone, the so-called \"spaghetti plot\", or ensemble graphic ( Figure  2), shows individual tracks of selected models, but also struggles to efectively communicate uncertainty. The distinct tracks tend to be read as overly deterministic, especially when they coincide with signifcant landmarks [96]. Interpreting spaghetti plots can also be more cognitively taxing than for other visual hurricane forecast representations [26]. We return to the question of the cone in Section 5.1.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_abstract": "This paper joins the growing body of critical HCI work that studies the digitization of the Global South and reports the elements of \u2018secularization\u2019 in it.

What is geographically relevant is infuenced by user-specifc factors, such as risk perception, the infuence of neighbors, residence construction, access to transportation, awareness of evacuation zones, and media reference to local landmarks [124]. Many of our interviewees noted the difculty in accessing localized forecasts and protective action recommendations from government information products and social media posts, highlighting that ofcial hurricane risk maps are typically at the regional or national scale.

In order to enhance data communication, infographics often utilize embellished versions of common chart types [21,36]. The visual embellishments usually include pictographic elements [15], textual annotations [30], and elaborately designed figures and imageries [1,9,20]. When incorporating appropriate embellishments, infographics can effectively convey messages, present insights, and tell stories about data in an aesthetically pleasing, memorable, and engaging style [1,15,17,22,23]. As a result, infographics have become increasingly popular in a variety of fields. The demands for crafting infographics have gone beyond graphic designers and visualization experts.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept.

While the forms of infographics greatly diverge, we focus on one of the most common categories, variations of common data visualizations with visual embellishments. Traditionally, visual embellishments are considered harmful [38]. Visualizations are usually kept plain for the effectiveness of data analysis. Recently, researchers have started to reveal the value of visual embellishments in data communication. For example, Bateman et al. [1] find the recall of embellished charts is significantly higher than plain charts. Haroz et al. [15] learn that ISOTYPE charts are equal to plain charts in terms of reading speed and accuracy, and the added visual information makes them more memorable. Others [5,6,7,35,36] also conclude that appropriate embellishments, such as color and the inclusion of recognizable objects, can increase memorability of visualizations. Besides, Byrne et al. find that figurative elements can effectively provide context, show content, and label data [9].

First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties. Thus, there is much opportunity for HCI and information visualization research to continue studying efective methods for uncertainty visualization approaches for hurricane forecasts [20] [105] [109] [113] [133].", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_4": "Several systems (Milne and Witten, 2008;Kulkarni et al., 2009;Hoffart et al., 2011) use the \"Milne and Witten\" measure for relatedness between a pair of entities, which is based on the number of Wikipedia articles citing each entity page, and the number of articles citing both; Cucerzan (2007) has also relied on the Wikipedia category structure.

Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy. A controversy is an issue that can inspire opposite positions and can be framed within opposite categories [3], [21], [29], [57]. In our case, the cyberattack represents the controversy, i.e., a behavior that can be framed either favorably or unfavorably.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_para_6": "Postphenomenological studies analyze the roles that technologies play in the relations between humans and world (human-technology relations: embodiment, alterity, hermeneutic, and background).

As we discussed earlier, there is an emerging body of work that considers humantechnology relations in HCI [9,10,20,[24][25][26][27][28]33,42,44].

At the same time, we aimed through digital technologies to make the bowl unfamiliar, challenging expectations and assumed roles, however in such a way as not to overshadow its familiarity. This approach to defamiliarizing was with the intention of making it simultaneously familiar and strange, and therefore best open to reflection and analysis of the particularities of non-normative perceptions of humantechnology relations and qualities of experience. To support these aims and in keeping with a counterfactual artifact [41] and research product [23], we crafted the Tilting Bowl with a great deal of purpose and quality so it would fit with and be robust enough for everyday settings over time. Additionally, we drew on ideas of unawareness [22], and unselfconscious interaction [38] to guide the design in which the artifact required no human attention nor user interface to function, and the Tilting Bowl suggested more incremental engagements or intersections rather than explicit interaction. Furthermore, it could easily become a part of ad hoc and changing configurations in a home with other objects in what is referred to as ensembles [22,38]. In these respects, the Tilting Bowl was designed specifically to inquire through lived-with experience into the types and qualities of relationships beyond use and functionality that may emerge.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_metadata": "Authors: E.

However, very recent empirical studies show that some self-attention heads make little contribution and can be pruned as redundant heads. This work takes a novel perspective of identifying and then vitalizing redundant heads. We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads. Experimental results on widely adopted WMT14 and WMT16 English to German and English to Czech language machine translation validate the RHE effectiveness.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_metadata": "Authors: Yechun Tang, Xiaoxia Cheng, Weiming Lu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_metadata": "Authors: Min-Hsuan Yeh, Lun-Wei Ku | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_metadata": "Authors: \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Sungjin Ahn, Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_metadata": "Authors: Meishan Zhang, Zhang Meishan, Zhang Yue, Fu Guo-hong | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

We address a new application of attention, and introduce a significantly different attention mechanism, which allows each variable to focus on multiple objects. We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

Conversational Question Answering: This is a conversational search task, where the system needs to correctly interpret a question in the context of an ongoing conversation. Most research on conversational QA focuses on conversational response ranking tasks (Dalton et al., 2019(Dalton et al., , 2020(Dalton et al., , 2021 and extractive QA tasks (Choi et al., 2018;Reddy et al., 2019;Qu et al., 2019b;Yeh and Chen, 2019). Qu et al. (2020) were first to define the task of Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (OR-ConvQA), where the system is required to learn to retrieve top relevant passages from a large collection before extracting answers from the passages. To address the ORConvQA task, Qu et al. (2020) proposed a three-stage pipeline: (1) a retriever, (2) a reranker, and (3) a reader. Later, Qu et al. (2021) introduced a learned weakly-supervised training approach to address the problem of accessing gold passages during the training of the model on the OR-CoQA dataset in (Qu et al., 2020). One particular problem is coarse ranking, where the reranker of Qu et al. (2020) only takes the top-ranked passages as input. This makes the whole pipeline suffers from this coarse ranking, especially for situations when the golden passages are not retrieved in the top-ranked passages. Liang et al. (2022) addressed this issue by adding a post-ranker module that can push more relevant passages to the reader. However, these works typically approach reranking and reading as classification tasks to find an answer span for retrieved passages (start/end positions). Instead, we use a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader in order to directly extract the answers for the users instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_11": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Conversational QA: MTL methods have recently been effectively implemented in existing Conversational QA works (Kongyoung et al., 2020;Qu et al., 2019b;Xu et al., 2019;Yeh and Chen, 2019;Qu et al., 2020Qu et al., , 2021. However, all of the tasks in these works leverage MTL by sharing the network structure between an extractive reader and its auxiliary tasks, which are typically classification tasks, such as a yes/no question prediction or a follow-up question prediction. For example, some existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021 have applied MTL on reranking and answer reading by adding two fully-connected layers (one for the reranker and reader, respectively) to find an answer span for the retrieved passages (start/end positions). Instead, in this paper, we leverage MTL on reranking and answer extraction by sharing a single text generation model in order to directly extract the answers instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage. On the other hand, Ide and Kawahara (2021) recently adopted an MTL approach that involves both classification and text generation tasks.

However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has combined monoT5 and UnifiedQA by sharing a single text generation model, in order to directly extract the answers instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_2": "Recently, Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which is a method of learning multiple different but related tasks at the same time, has become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model (Qu et al., 2019b).

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever. We also consider other recent existing bi-encoder passage retrievers such as TCT-ColBERT (Lin et al., 2021b, 2020a and CQE (Lin et al., 2021a) as baseline passage retrievers.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_5": "The right part of Figure 3 presents our proposed model, which uses T5, a large pre-trained language models designed for text generation.

To adopt an MTL approach to a text generation model for jointly learning from both passage reranking and answer extraction, the MTL model makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task and the follow-up tokens for the answer extraction task. In particular, when fine-tuning the T5 model for a downstream task, we use Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify the model by using a taskspecific prompt together with the input . We deploy a T5 model to capture the relation between the rewritten question q r of the current question q c and the passage p as shown in the right part of Figure 3.

This task is an extractive type of QA, meaning that the answer takes the form of a span in the provided passage, and can be successfully tackled by employing an extractive or generative reader. Extractive reader models (Qu et al., 2019a,b;Yeh and Chen, 2019) are typically employed, where the goal is to classify the start and end positions of the answer span in the given passage. In contrast, generative readers (Raffel et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020; have demonstrated impressive results on the extractive QA tasks, where the goal is to generate tokens that are a subset of a passage. Recently, there has been more focus on retrieval as part of the ConvQA pipeline, known as Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (ORConvQA).

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_7": "To conduct our evaluation of monoQA, we choose the OR-QuAC (Qu et al., 2020) and OR-CoQA (Qu et al., 2021) datasets, which are extractive Question Answering (QA) datasets.

Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_para_4": "Another stream of research for question generation is from KG to question.

This problem becomes more serious when the complexity of the question rises. Some works propose to solve this problem by modelling the hierarchical structure of logical forms. Dong and Lapata (2016) introduces a sequence-to-tree model with an attention mechanism. Dong and Lapata (2018) proposes to decode a sketch of the logical forms which contain a set of functions at first and then decode low-level details like arguments. Guo et al.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

(2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain.

We propose to adopt an argumentative approach to identify which premises allow such legitimization. To showcase this approach, we created four short narratives describing cyberattacks involving generic users and covering different motives for the attacks: profit, recreation, revenge, and ideology. A sample of 16 participants read the four narratives and was afterward interviewed to express their position on the attacks described. All interview transcripts were then analyzed with an argumentative approach, and 15 premises were found to account for the different positions taken. We describe the premises, their distribution across the four narratives, and discuss the implications of this approach for cybersecurity.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_1": "We propose that legitimization of cyberattacks is made possible by the argumentative nature of position-taking. Assigning someone the status of the victim or the ofender is the result of an interpretive, interactional process [23] [56]. identifying the premises on which favorable argumentation rests would help to understand how lay citizens could legitimize (or condemn) cyberattacks. (We prefer to use the term legitimized over neutralized or justifed/excused because the former term assumes a cognitive model that is not necessary to our purpose; the terms justifed or excused only refer to a subset of neutralization techniques, and are then not adequate to refer to all techniques in general [49].) To showcase this argumentative approach to legitimization, we study the position on cyberattacks of a small sample of university students, who represent a typical participant in the literature on cybercrime [5]. The investigation uses a refexive thematic analysis [6] [7], which is open to the arguments spontaneously used by the participants. The purpose is not to map the entire argumentative space used by university students to make sense of cyberattacks, but to illustrate an argumentative approach and draw some cybersecurity implications from the results. We will start by briefy explaining what we mean by \"argumentative\".", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_3": "To convert this conceptual approach to position-taking into an investigation methodology means to capture the premises mobilized when taking a favorable about a controversial behavior. Consistently, in our study, the participants did not rate pre-formulated arguments (as in [29] or [38]) but worked their way to a position during open answers to interviews. This allowed them to use the arguments that spontaneously occurred while answering and to take articulated and ambivalent positions as they were considering various sides of the attack. What we valued were the arguments that backed such positions, not the positions themselves. An argumentative method also needs to consider various scenarios in which a controversial behavior can appear. Our study used four diferent cyberattack scenarios inspired by common motives for cyberattacks reported in the literature and applicable to general users.", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_5": "The cyberattack scenarios we created varied in their motives. The early taxonomies published in the literature distinguish between four motives, i.e., curiosity, proft, notoriety, and revenge [20], [45]. Curiosity is the pursuit of the excitement connected to intellectual challenges. Proft refers to actions driven by greed or personal fnancial gain\" ( [45], p.100). Notoriety, also called prestige, consists of pursuing \"media attention, bragging, and the quest for fame\" ( [45], p. 100). Revenge is the search for compensating a tort sufered by the attacker. We excluded notoriety and curiosity from this original set of four motives because they did not ft our purposes: we were interested in cases involving lay people in the attack and not in a single attacker wanting to gain popularity or test their talent. We then added recreation or fun [17] and ideology, which refers to ideological and societal motives [50]. Our fnal set of motives then included: proft, revenge, recreation, and ideology.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_0": "In sociology, Sykes and Matza [53] proposed the notion of neutralization; according to them, criminals do not belong to a deviant subculture that inverts the values of the 'respectable' society [53]. Instead, criminals keep some commitments to the dominant values of society and use some techniques to conciliate them with their criminal acts. Sykes and Matza identifed fve such techniques: denying the responsibility, denying the negativity of the efects, turning the victim or the condemners into culprits, or appealing to higher values [53]. Their ideas have been extensively used in the study of criminal behavior, included within various theoretical frameworks [33], and re-elaborated by Scott and Lyman's theory of accounts [49]. They have also been applied to the study of cybercrime, and evidence of recourse to all fve types of neutralization techniques has been found so far in research on hackers [24]. When it comes to understanding lay citizens' participation in cyberattacks, which is the topic of this paper, Sykes and Mazda's theory suggests that the distinction between a community of criminals and the community of law-abiding citizens is culturally more blurred than one might assume. One does not need to give up all values of the dominant society to legitimize their illegal behaviors. Indeed, Chua et al [9] as well as Morris et al [38] surveyed college students and found such neutralization techniques. Morris et al., in particular, investigated common forms of computer hacking, such as accessing somebody else's device or guessing somebody else's password [38].", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_2": "The clearest theorization of attitudes as positions in an argumentative space is due to the discursive psychologist Michael Billig, according to whom culture ofers a set of shared and accepted commonplaces [3] both in favor and against a given controversial behavior [3]. An example is provided by the debate on Facebook's policy on users' personal data: their policy was justifed in the name of the free, valuable service it provided but also criticized in the name of transparency [41]. Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy. A controversy is an issue that can inspire opposite positions and can be framed within opposite categories [3], [21], [29], [57].

Colnago et al. [14] documented the attitudes and behaviors surrounding twofactor authentication (2FA) as it was rolled out at a large research university. Regarding account sharing, the authors found that 2FA interfered with the ability of some students to share their financial accounts with parents, because the parents could only use the shared password at a time when the students were available to answer the 2FA push notification. They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities. They found that about half did not make their security policies publicly accessible, and that these policies were seldom consistent or shared source materials; moreover, the policies tended to be difficult to read, lacking in emotional language, and worded ambiguously and/or tentatively, such that the takeaways were unclear.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_1": "However, one important work setting has so far been understudied: the research university. In 2018 in the U.S., about 6,000 postsecondary schools employed nearly 4 million [70] and served 16.6 million enrolled undergraduate students [71]. These are unlike other workplaces because of their mission of academic freedom -the freedom to teach, to learn, to publish, and to inquire [4,46,72]. Consequently, IT strategies for securing the information network-in-use [73] is likely to center on intrusion detection [30] and to not include top-down methods of controlling user behavior (such as social media use policies, internet firewalls, or monitoring for data loss prevention). Some institutions use a federated IT model, which allows for subunits of the university such as schools or departments to hire IT staff and operate their own systems to, in part, \"enable research, teaching and community service\" [74]. They will tolerate or encourage CYOD and self-management of IT for their workforce, which is a mix of traditional in-office employees and of remote and/or mobile workers such as \"digital nomads\" [16,29,40]. For non-IT users, this could result in \"shadow security,\" workarounds to official rules and setups that help employees manage the risks they understand while getting their jobs done [35]. Academic freedom complicates the implementation and communication of university IT policies [14,62,63] and has led to conflicts with copyright holders over campus use of peer-to-peer file sharing [51]. Table 1: In comparison with a typical large-scale non-academic business in the U.S., the university in our study has a federated IT model and, among student employees, high turnover and many part-time jobs.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_metadata": "Authors: Yechun Tang, Xiaoxia Cheng, Weiming Lu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_metadata": "Authors: Kagonya Awori, M.

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_abstract": "Recurrent and convolutional neural networks comprise two distinct families of models that have proven to be useful for encoding natural language utterances.

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_metadata": "Authors: Bin Liang, Qinglin Zhu, Xiang Li, Min Yang, Lin Gui, Yulan He, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_para_4": "We use the LaBSE model to mine parallel text from CommonCrawl, a large-scale multilingual web corpus, and then train NMT models on the mined data.

We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods. Finally, we conduct human evaluations showing the applicability of our models in assisting experts to transcribe texts in extinct languages.", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_abstract": "In Machine Translation, assessing the quality of a large amount of automatic translations can be challenging. Automatic metrics are not reliable when it comes to high performing systems. In addition, resorting to human evaluators can be expensive, especially when evaluating multiple systems. To overcome the latter challenge, we propose a novel application of online learning that, given an ensemble of Machine Translation systems, dynamically converges to the best systems, by taking advantage of the human feedback available. Our experiments on WMT\u201919 datasets show that our online approach quickly converges to the top-3 ranked systems for the language pairs considered, despite the lack of human feedback for many translations.", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_abstract": "While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de.

However, very recent empirical studies show that some self-attention heads make little contribution and can be pruned as redundant heads. This work takes a novel perspective of identifying and then vitalizing redundant heads. We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads. Experimental results on widely adopted WMT14 and WMT16 English to German and English to Czech language machine translation validate the RHE effectiveness.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_metadata": "Authors: \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Sungjin Ahn, Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_para_1": "A good deal of prior work has focused on testing for linguistic knowledge in language models (Rogers et al., 2020).

(4) or Eq. (6) without interfering with the important head functions. (Voita et al., 2019) shows that redundant heads are mostly distributed in the lower encoder layers, meanwhile (Hao et al., 2019; shows that the bottom layer in the encoder, which directly takes word embedding as input, benefits more from modeling local relations. We evaluate the performance of applying our method on the low-and high-level encoder layers in the next section, and obtain the best performance when applying on the first encoder layer.  (Collins et al., 2005). The byte-pair encoding (BPE) toolkit 2 (Sennrich et al., 2016) is used with 32K merge operations. The 4-gram NIST BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) is used as the evaluation metric. We implement the proposed RHE and all the baselines on top of Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by using open-source toolkit OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017). Please refer to the Appendix for more details of dataset and parameter setting . Table 1 shows the ablation study results of the Transformer enabled by the two proposed SEA mechanisms DEA and LPEA and the RHE approach. First, the Rows of \"+DEA\" and \"+LPE\" represent the models with all heads of the first encoder layer, including original important heads, are replaced by the syntax-enhanced attention networks DEA and LPEA respectively. Second, the RHE approach (containing the Rows of \"+DEA+RHE\" and \"+LPEA+RHE\" ) significantly lifts both DEA and LPEA mechanisms across all small and large language pairs. This tests the effectiveness of identifying and modifying redundant heads without interfering important head functions. RHE lifts the LPEA, which together i.e. LPEA+RHE substantially outperforms Transformer by +1.0 BLEU points on En\u2192De (WMT16), +0.96 BLEU points on En\u2192De (WMT14), and +0.81 BLEU points on En\u2192Cs (WMT16).

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features.

They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept.

Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing, but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs, we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback. Our field study demonstrated the value of providing better and more extensive writing support on SNSs, and the potential of AI for building a more inclusive Internet.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_0": "Peer production is a powerful example of the potential of social computing in which communities like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM)-the 'Wikipedia of Maps' [32,73]create high-quality content at previously unimaginable scales.

[6] also emphasized the understanding of challenges and the importance of collaboration at the local levels. Conversely, the unintentional practice of ICTD researchers conducting short-term visits to complete their research to make publications and recommendations without any meaningful impact is also highlighted as an ethical concern and a reason behind the lack of sustainable impact of ICTD in Global South contexts [32,33]. In response, Dearden and Tucker [33] suggested that \"actors in the broader field of ICTD implementation (i.e., action by NGOs, aid agencies, and other organizations innovating and applying technology to development challenges) should examine how resources are used and how decisions are taken so that systemic and sustainable capacity building is prioritized. \"", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_5": "Bangladesh, being an agrarian economy, put additional emphasis on the digitization of agricultural markets at the governmental and non-governmental level.

This work, situated in an urban setting of Bangladesh, essentially represents a tension between tradition and modernity -a story that may have a resonance in many other places, too. This tension situates itself in Bangladesh through a historical trajectory of 'otherness' -while a part of this is formed by the contemporary manifestation of socio-religiosity, it is also comprised of the history of colonization, modernization, NGO-ization, and industrialization.

They highlighted many potentials of e-government and also noted how inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy and overall poor-quality governance restrict sustainable innovations in developments in the Global South [13,14,24]. Toyoma broadly working in the interaction of ICTD and HCID, argued that digital innovations may amplify human development in a broad set of global development contexts, where institutions and responsible individuals work with optimistic and good intentions [118]. However, it has not been well-explored how multi-sectoral decision-makers, including national governments, INGOs, UN organizations, and donors, work, perceive, and interact in a very specific development sector (such as the public health nutrition development context in Bangladesh) towards digital innovation and their implications for CSCW and HCI practitioners for sustainable development.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_abstract": "Historically, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) researchers in the Global South have advocated for a community-based approach to technology design and development. However, even with this \"bottom-up\" emphasis, the sustainability and scalability of the resulting innovations remain major challenges, and are poorly understood. To address this gap, we take the case of Bangladesh as a typical Global South context in which development work is carried out by a complex intertwined network of stakeholders across governments, NGOs, donors, and industries. To better understand the current development landscape and its priorities for digital technologies, we conducted interviews with 14 influential decision-makers in Bangladesh who play significant roles in the development of nutrition strategies. Our findings highlight a disconnect between the Bangladesh government's \"digital mandate\" and the reality of digital innovation practice within the nutrition development sector. Our paper contributes to the debate on factors that affect decision-making processes. We explore the dynamics of diverse actors and institutions who are intended to participate in, but can act as obstacles to sustained bottom-up innovations. Our findings expand understanding of institutional priorities, the dynamics of intermediaries, techno-solutionism, postcolonialism, bureaucracy, competition, and other important topics in CSCW scholarship. We suggest understanding the factors that guide the decision-making process of digital innovation practices in terms of four dimensions: internal, external, vertical, and horizontal. Consequently, we recommend CSCW and HCI researchers become mediators to connect decision-makers and communities and bring their voices in ICT innovations for global development. Finally, we offer recommendations for proactive engagement with decision-making stakeholders, enabling researchers to design community-centered sustainable digital innovations for development.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_3": "The importance of understanding the high-level decision-making context has also been well recognized and highlighted by the broader HCI community [12,57,72,73]. While many studies focus on the bottom-level local context of program implementation [6,31,120] and note the importance of understanding political analysis [123], there has been sparse reporting on the highlevel context in which policy and programs are formed. Heeks emphasized that the high rate of ICTD program failure arises from the \"design-reality gaps\" that arise from a lack of understanding of decision-makers' and program designers' contexts [53]. Overall, sufficient insights have not yet been articulated on the high-level political contexts and actors, such as the political visions and priorities influencing and driving ICTD programs and how projects and policies change as they go through a central authority (from the government to national and international organizations, including donors) [124]. We intend to contribute to this discussion by presenting the nature and roots of these gaps in the public health nutrition context in Bangladesh.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_16": "Sustainable impact requires interventions to \"recognize and leverage resources already existing in the community, including physical and social infrastructure, skills, knowledge, networks, and environmental resources\" [95]. Partly driven by a political mandate to engage youth explicitly as part of their digital innovation strategy, our participants argued for leveraging youth potential, seeing them as agents of change. This a priori interest in youth engagement signifies how decisionmakers think of population segments, which will be key in successful innovation diffusion. Notably, this is not limited only to creating youth-friendly applications or creating \"lite\" youth versions of apps aimed at adults. Youth are traditionally construed as \"human becomings,\" \"denigrating their present lives, while focusing only on the adults they will become\" [7]. For decision-makers, the youth of today have an essential role to play in Bangladesh's digital innovation narrative in the present. This is also a strategic decision when it is considered that 40% of the country's population is under the age of 18, a phenomenon that is not exclusive to Bangladesh [104]. The UK's leading development institute, ODI, argues that since the world now has the largest generation aged 15-24 in history (and 90% of these youth live in Global South countries), a unique opportunity is afforded to development practitioners and theorists. There is \"a one-time window of opportunity for a concerted international effort to help developing countries reap a 'demographic dividend' from educated, healthy and gainfully employed young women and men, and achieve far higher economic growth rates\" [96]. However, we also urge caution here and advise that any attempts to mediate youth engagement with decision-makers needs to be carried out with the utmost care. Though ostensibly motivated by youth empowerment, authorities as well as non-state actors have repeatedly sought to disrupt spaces for youth participation or co-opt them towards their own political agendas. Moreover, if development projects consider youth perspectives and motivations for development, they can be included in initiatives whose primary target populations are adults. For instance, when targeting information dissemination to women farmers, we should consider young people's role as change-makers in farming communities. Hence, we recommend that every national and regional development context has population segments that are prioritized for innovation roll-out due to factors such as high early adoption rates or alignment with national agendas. When configuring projects, we recommend that HCI researchers consider how their projects will leverage these population segments to maximize their impact.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_10": "Our findings show how the priorities of higher-level stakeholders, such as governments, UN groups, and donor agencies, shape ICT innovations in nutrition development programs in Bangladesh and that the opportunities for bottom-up approaches to innovation in public health nutrition in Bangladesh are still limited. The tendency of governments and donors to push technology innovations into Global South contexts is not a new phenomenon, as discussed in literature that we highlighted in our related work section. However, distinctions between the ways in which top-down authority is invoked is necessary to clarify that the actions of high-level policymakers, government officeholders, and multinational NGOs are not necessarily antithetical to the success of development innovations. Those involved in CSCW and HCI4D have long advocated for engaging with under-represented groups and bringing under-explored topics to the fore. We extend this line of work by arguing for incorporating marginalized communities' voices as part of an engagement with program and policy makers into the decision-making process. Our findings highlight that this incorporation is often challenged by various internal and external factors in the local governing system. By considering the interactions among diverse top-down institutions [58,76,114,115] their institutioning, the intermediaries involved (such as multi-sectoral actors in government INGOs and donor agencies), and the dynamics of intermediation, we can articulate how they work and where HCI can contribute in the processes of digital innovations with and for marginalized communities. Hence, we suggest that HCI researchers develop a nuanced understanding of the policy and program-making contexts within which their intervention is placed. We suggest there is a potentially fruitful opportunity for HCI researchers to take a middle-man approach and connect the bottom-up and top-down contexts [37].", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_7": "In the frst phase, we concentrated on studying (i) sacrifcial animal production in rural Bangladesh, (ii) urban activities at traditional cattle markets in Dhaka city, and (iii) traditional religious performances of the urban dwellers during this religious festival of Eid ul Adha. To document sacrifcial animal production, mobilization, and marketing, we selected fve villages (Talgachi, Garadoho, Purantepri, Mushipur, and Barabil) of Sirajganj District, which were popular for raising cattle heads for Eid. After selecting these villages, the ethnographer reached out to people in her social network to access the farmers' communities in each of these villages. For each of these villages, we had more than one 'gatekeepers' [90]. The gatekeepers would live in those villages for at least ten years, and they were also connected to cattle farms and farmers' communities there. In these villages we interviewed 7 khamaris, 12 byaparis, and 14 individual farmers (8 men, 6 women). The age of these participants ranged from 22-50 yrs. Eleven among them never received any formal education. The interviews were semi-structured and were 30-40 minutes long on average. We asked them about their farm's business model, the impacts of digitization of the country on their farm, and their future plans, among others. We also asked the farmers about their cattle-raising processes and their experiences of staying in Dhaka for selling their cattle heads during Eid ul Adha. We observed and took note of the cattle-raising spaces and associated infrastructures as well. We then had fve focus group discussions with the farmers, political leaders (popularly known as 'Chairman'), and the byaparis. In these FGDs, we discussed how they worked together to arrange the \"chalan\" or supply of cattle heads before Eid, how the Chairmen infuenced the overall process, and how convenient mobile phone applications (Imo, Viber, What-sApp, etc.) were for the farmers, among others. The participants' ages ranged from 25-60 yrs. In total, 19 people participated in these 5 FGDs (4-8 participants in one group). Each FGD was 40 minutes long on average. Although female members of the farmers' families (who were directly involved with the cattle-raising process) participated in the individual interviews, they were not present in the FGDs following the village norms. Both the interviews and FGDs followed the local cultural norms.

Thousands of products and services are being published, promoted, and purchased over various online platforms ranging from government-developed websites to personal Facebook pages of the sellers [20,66,100]. One of the newest additions of this trend is the digitization of the 'physical' cattle markets (traditionally held in the urban areas during Eid), which has received signifcant attention in Bangladesh recently. Such transformations often engender many socio-cultural tensions and put the efort of digitizing the countries in the Global South into question. While a rich body of literature in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD), and related felds has focused on diferent aspects of digital marketplaces [36,50,59,101], very few studies have been conducted in the context of the Global South [42,104,131].

Much of this research has turned problems of environmental action into questions of personal moral choice, often focusing on behavior change as a route to altering individual consumption patterns [10]. An alternative path has focused on 'ecologies of practices' within design and HCI [8,27]. In the manifestos the latter approach to sustainability is more apparent. Just a few documents imagine how IoT could be used to change, augment or improve individual behavior (Kr\u00fcger, RIOT; Smit, RIOT).

Similarly, the 'Our Story' (currently known as 'Indaba') participatory video platform was pioneered by HCI researchers by leveraging the institutional networks of the Red Cross Movement's umbrella body IFRC (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, who operate on both top-down and bottom-up dimensions [126]). Through this collaboration, a number of relationships with NGOs at the local level were brokered (with the Indonesian Red Cross and Namibian Red Cross, for example) [11] which were used by the IFRC to advocate for sustained use of the tool within the wider network. Finally, RootIO (a platform for low-cost community radio) similarly credits their success to extensive collaborations with content partners, politicians, community leaders, networks of youth centers, and contacts within government ministries [26,29]. Indeed, RootIO collaborated with national communications regulators and involved local community NGOs [28] in each deployment. We recommend that as part of the requirement of initial informationgathering within social computing and HCI for development project collaborations, researchers should find out the priorities of local political stakeholders who play influential roles in regional development and areas of alignment or difference between collaborators and other NGOs and government ministries who work in that sector.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_9": "We conducted the second phase of our study (February 2020-August 2020) remotely amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The review on HCI4D by Dell and Kumar noted that, \"nearly half of the papers (128) target 'ground-level users' to respond to their specific needs and challenges\" [35].

Furthermore, researchers have also shown that there is a big push in the Global South to transfer technologies from the West and use them in international development contexts, copying the western practice of innovation [59], which is compounded by the UN and other NGOs advocating for the innovation and use of digital technology towards achieving all SDGs [89]. While there is a definite upward trend of using ICT in most development programs and projects, an inability to sustain such innovation for an extended period after the initial research is conducted, so as to be able to scale up technology-based programs and projects, remains an absolute constraint [8,31,51,54,123,124].

However, the inability to sustain a more extended period to scale up technology-based programs and projects remain as absolute constraints in Global South countries [31,51,54,120,123,125].

In this regard, HCI has been examined through the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu and its philosophical underpinnings have been used as a structural basis which grants situated orientation [58] and provides a relevant framework for design innovation, technology use, its adoption, and how it can drive business innovation in Africa. In recent years, HCI has gained traction in Africa with a strong emphasis on opportunities availed by mobile technologies and increased access to internet and affordability of devices. This has led to great emphasis on design and deployment of usercentered digital solutions that are enmeshed with the needs of an African audience to solve African problems.

Without any advertising, training, or airtime subsidies, Karamad organically engaged 725 workers who completed 3,939 tasks (involving 43,006 components) including translations, dataset generation, and surveys on demographics, accessibility, disability, health, employment, and literacy.

To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015).

There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b).

For well-studied conventional feature-based models in NLP, there are various classic transfer approaches, such as EasyAdapt (Daum\u00e9, 2007), instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and structural correspondence learning (Blitzer et al., 2006). Fewer works have been focused on transfer approaches for neural models in NLP. Mou et al. (2016) use intuitive transfer methods (INIT and MULT) to study the transferability of neural network models for the sentence (pair) classification problem; Lee et al. (2017) utilize the INIT method on highly related datasets of electronic health records to study their specific deidentification problem. Yang et al. (2017b) use the MULT approach in sequence tagging tasks including named entity recognition. Following the MULT scheme, Wang et al. (2018) introduce a label-aware mechanism into maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to explicitly reduce domain shift between the same labels across domains in medical data. Their approach requires the output space to be the same in both source and target domains. Note that the scenario in our paper is that the output spaces are different in two domains.", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_metadata": "Authors: Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, D.

Equipping the model with such a capacity allows it to learn languages at multiple levels of granularity, ranging from fine-grain connections across words to high-level discourse relations between sentences and paragraphs.", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_para_0": "Zero-shot translation Our work is closely related to that of zero-shot translation (Johnson et al., 2017;Al-Shedivat and Parikh, 2019). However, while zero-shot translation translates between a language pair with no parallel data, there is an assumption that both languages in the target pair have some parallel data with other languages. As such, the system can learn to process both languages. In one work, Currey and Heafield (2019) improved zero-shot translation using monolingual data on the pivot language. However, in our scenario, there is no parallel data between the low-resource language and any other language. In other work, Arivazhagan et al. (2019) showed that adding adversarial training to the encoder output could help zero shot training. We adopt a similar philosophy in our multi-task training to ensure our low-resource target is in the same latent space as the higher-resource language.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware"}}

This system supports group work and individual work and the transition between them. Agrawala et al. [2] also proposed a tabletop system with shutter glasses for multiple users. In this system, the user wears 3D glasses, and communication is interrupted. Pivot [20] provides the personal and shared views without glasses, but the quality of the image degrades as the number of users increases. MisTable [32] establishes a personal workspace with a fog screen and shared space with a tabletop display, but users are fixed at four sides of the table and must sit with a fog screen between them and the tabletop. Our system does not require 3D glasses; it can be viewed anywhere around the circular screen, and there is no loss of resolution due to the number of people increasing. Therefore, it can be used as a collaborative work interface to solve existing limitations.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_metadata": "Authors: A.

We introduce a novel, large, and diverse dataset of written code-switched productions, curated from topical threads of multiple bilingual communities on the Reddit discussion platform, and explore questions that were mainly addressed in the context of spoken language thus far. We investigate whether findings in oral code-switching concerning content and style, as well as speaker proficiency, are carried over into written code-switching in discussion forums.

Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116]. Besides these moderation rules, we also use the \"nest level\" of a comment as a control.

Two coders labelled 4,500 unique comments with at least one of the thirteen types of essential components extracted from our theoretical analysis (see label development documentation in Section 3.4 and Appendix B). To ensure intercoder reliability and the representativeness of the sample, we performed the following procedures. First, coders discussed the developed minimal theoretic conceptualization, reviewed predefined examples for each class, and resolved any questions about the nature of the classes. Then, both coders labelled the same set of 100 random comments from the corpus, yielding a Krippendorf alpha of 0.7. After discussing prevailing differences in the coding tactics, coders learned to adjust their coding in a way that conformed more to the theoretic framework. Coders then relabelled the same corpus, yielding an intercoder reliability of 0.75. This was higher than the expected minimum for coding complicated language tasks in the literature (>0.6 -see e.g., [5,37,43,92,105,122]). Since coders' labeling practices were robust, they proceeded with the selection and labeling of further comments. Specifically, an initial sample of 1650 comments was labeled, containing 30 comments from each subreddit in the dataset. Next, a second batch of 1000 comments was annotated, which we randomly selected by stratified sampling among subreddits. To assess how many comments were necessary for an accurate classifier, we trained a preliminary language model on these 2750 comments, finding that for reliable prediction for each class, at least 300 observations were necessary. To satisfy this condition, we continued labeling comments by stratified random sampling until an annotated sample of 4500 comments was produced.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_4": "We used a qualitative, two stage, approach to understanding our data.

Second, we were interested in the discussions surrounding bots on the Reddit platform. As such, we conducted a Thematic Analysis of all submission and comment data. Following [9], we coded individual submissions and comments, when necessary at the sentence to paragraph level, to summarise content for semantic and latent meaning. Once all data was coded, we compared and contrasted codes, grouped related codes together, and used these as the starting point for creating themes. Finally, we selected exemplar data as evidence of talk underpinning themes to be presented as part of our findings. The coding process across both stages was conducted by three researchers, who regularly met to share codes, discuss different interpretations of data, and to refine codes and subsequent themes.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_metadata": "Authors: Ella Rabinovich, Masih Sultani, S.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_5": "As a study that sets out to describe and explain rather than create, this work of action research brings together virtual ethnography [11] with the emerging practice of \"popular data,\" where researchers and participants create questions and interpretations together [10,19].

Contrastingly, Nashei et al [38] highlight that good questions on the same platform tend to encourage continued discussion where the initial problem gets redefined. Similarly, those responses that work best tend to be those that are concise, refer back to the question asked, highlight key elements, and provide step-by-step instructions and explore multiple solutions.

Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_6": "At the same time, however, we also saw examples where discussions on Reddit exposed opportunities for engaging with and learning about the underlying software processes through which bots operate. We observed nuanced cocreation processes surrounding proposing, discussing, motivating, releasing and maintaining a bot. We saw the ways in which the suggestion of bot ideas, the receiving of feedback on these ideas from a supportive community of developers, and then the iteration of these through discussion, enabled lay community members to see their initial ideas come to life. We also observed how existing bots became exemplars and prototypes on which new ideas were built. They became ways to peek behind the curtain of bot design and implementation. In some cases this was through watching the trial and error of a creator. In others it was through learning new coding skills themselves via the help and support of more experienced peers. As such, while there was in some cases no exchange of code the interactions observed were akin to forms of legitimate peripheral participation [31] observed in open source communities [13,68] and in situated studies of learning programing skills [13,49]. Therefore, while there were clearly challenges associated with the creation of bot ideas requested by novices, there is great potential to see acts of making bots as sites where the mysterious \u00d2black box\u00d3 of technology can be unpicked and understood.

[48] and Wright et al. [127] developed coding schemes for labeling user content as deliberative based on features such as rationality and constructiveness. Guimaraes et al. [55] formulated the conversational archetypes \"harmony\", \"discrepancy\", \"disruption\", and \"dispute\" to describe online political discourse. Lee et al.

Evidently, prior research that investigates political rhetoric on social media has only used basic conceptualizations of political discourse theories.

Based on this finding, we suggest existing communities should educate members to try to understand the intent of the contributors and provide constructive suggestions when conflicts occur. The online collaboration systems should also support flexible interfaces for members to conveniently provide suggestions. In Wikipedia, newcomers' edits are often reverted without any further information. According to Halfaker's paper [17], this might be a cause of the slower growth of Wikipedia's editor base. They then proposed a tool to present newcomers' activity traces to Wikipedian mentors, and this information significantly helped mentors to provide more explanations about edit reverts [18].

Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship between social media interface design and respectful political discussion among users.1", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_metadata": "Authors: Ga\u00ebl Guibon, Matthieu Labeau, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flamein, Luce Lefeuvre, C.

Previous research efforts generally address the ASTE task in an end-to-end fashion through the table-filling formalization, in which the triplets are represented by a two-dimensional (2D) table of word-pair relations. Under this formalization, a term-level relation is decomposed into multiple independent word-level relations, which leads to relation inconsistency and boundary insensitivity in the face of multi-word aspect terms and opinion terms. To overcome these issues, we propose Boundary-Driven Table-Filling (BDTF), which represents each triplet as a relation region in the 2D table and transforms the ASTE task into detection and classification of relation regions. We also notice that the quality of the table representation greatly affects the performance of BDTF. Therefore, we develop an effective relation representation learning approach to learn the table representation, which can fully exploit both word-to-word interactions and relation-to-relation interactions. Experiments on several public benchmarks show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performances.", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_para_3": "We categorize the baselines into four groups: tablefilling methods, span-based methods, generative methods, and other methods.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours. Other related work on predicting aspect include systems aiming at identifying lexical aspect (Siegel and McKeown, 2000;Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) or habituals (Mathew and Katz, 2009;Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015).", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_para_5": "Subsequent works address the ASTE task by transforming it into the position-aware tagging problem , the machine reading comprehension task (Chen et al., 2021a;Mao et al., 2021), the table-filling problem (Wu et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2021b;Jing et al., 2021;Chen et al., 2022), the span-relation extraction problem (Xu et al., 2021;Li et al., 2022a), and the sequence generation task (Yan et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2021c;Mukherjee et al., 2021;Lu et al., 2022).", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

Eisenschlos et al., 2020 further pre-train Tapas on counterfactually-augmented and grammar-based synthetic statements. Schlichtkrull et al., 2021 study table-based fact verification in an open-domain setting, and combine a TF-IDF retrieval model with a RoBERTabased joint reranking-and-verification model. Tapex  guides the pre-trained BART model to mimic an SQL executor via an execution-centric table pre-training approach. The pre-training corpus of Tapex is synthesized via sampling SQL queries from the SQUALL dataset (Shi et al., 2020). SaMoE (Zhou et al., 2022) develops a mixtureof-experts network based on the RoBERTa-large model (Liu et al., 2019). The MoE network consists of different experts, and then a management module decides the contribution of each expert network to the verification result. Volta (Gautam et al., 2021) analyzes how transfer learning and standardizing tables to contain a single header row can boost the effectiveness of tablebased fact verification. LKA (Zhao and Yang, 2022) studies the sentencetable's evidence correlation.

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_metadata": "Authors: Shaolei Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

This method uses a verbalization with a program execution model to accumulate evidences and constructs a graph attention network to combine various evidences. Tapas (Herzig et al., 2020) extends BERT with additional structure-aware positional embeddings to represent the tables. Eisenschlos et al., 2020 further pre-train Tapas on counterfactually-augmented and grammar-based synthetic statements. Schlichtkrull et al., 2021 study table-based fact verification in an open-domain setting, and combine a TF-IDF retrieval model with a RoBERTabased joint reranking-and-verification model. Tapex  guides the pre-trained BART model to mimic an SQL executor via an execution-centric table pre-training approach. The pre-training corpus of Tapex is synthesized via sampling SQL queries from the SQUALL dataset (Shi et al., 2020). SaMoE (Zhou et al., 2022) develops a mixtureof-experts network based on the RoBERTa-large model (Liu et al., 2019). The MoE network consists of different experts, and then a management module decides the contribution of each expert network to the verification result. Volta (Gautam et al., 2021) analyzes how transfer learning and standardizing tables to contain a single header row can boost the effectiveness of tablebased fact verification. LKA (Zhao and Yang, 2022) studies the sentencetable's evidence correlation. It develops a dualview alignment module based on the statement and table views to identify the most important words through various interactions.", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_metadata": "Authors: Mingyang Zhou, Josh Arnold, Zhou Yu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

However, there is a significant semantic and structural gap between natural language and action sequences, which makes this conversion difficult. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-enhanced complex question answering framework, called ALCQA, which mitigates this gap through question-to-action alignment and question-to-question alignment. We train a question rewriting model to align the question and each action, and utilize a pretrained language model to implicitly align the question and KG artifacts. Moreover, considering that similar questions correspond to similar action sequences, we retrieve top-k similar question-answer pairs at the inference stage through question-to-question alignment and propose a novel reward-guided action sequence selection strategy to select from candidate action sequences. We conduct experiments on CQA and WQSP datasets, and the results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and obtains a 9.88% improvements in the F1 metric on CQA dataset.

These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex.

Compared to simple questions with single or multihop of relations, complex questions have more kinds of answer types such as numeric or boolean types and require more kinds of aggregation operations like min/max or intersection/union to yield answers. Semantic parsing approaches typically map questions to intermediate logical forms such as query graphs (Yih et al., 2015;Bao et al., 2016;Bhutani et al., 2019;Maheshwari et al., 2019;Lan * Corresponding author. and Jiang, 2020;Qin et al., 2021), and further transform them into queries like SPARQL query language. Recently, many works (Liang et al., 2017;Hua et al., 2020a,b,c) predefine a collection of functions with constrained argument types and represent the intermediate logical form as a sequence of actions that can be generated using a seq2seq model. Sequencebased methods are natural to accomplish more complex operations by simply expanding the function set, thus making some logically complex questions answerable while they're difficult to answer using query graphs.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_abstract": "We present the first comprehensive study on automatic knowledge base construction for two prevalent commonsense knowledge graphs: ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) and ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_abstract": "While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever.

However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline.

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

However, large language model pre-training costs intensive computational resources, and most of the models are trained from scratch without reusing the existing pre-trained models, which is wasteful. In this paper, we propose bert2BERT, which can effectively transfer the knowledge of an existing smaller pre-trained model to a large model through parameter initialization and significantly improve the pre-training efficiency of the large model. Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving method proposed in computer vision on the Transformer-based language model, and further improve it by proposing a novel method, advanced knowledge for large model\u2019s initialization. In addition, a two-stage learning method is proposed to further accelerate the pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments on representative PLMs (e.g., BERT and GPT) and demonstrate that (1) our method can save a significant amount of training cost compared with baselines including learning from scratch, StackBERT and MSLT; (2) our method is generic and applicable to different types of pre-trained models.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_abstract": "While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored.

There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning.

This suggests that the signal from pretraining is stronger than that of the Akkadian texts, likely due to the relatively small amounts of data. Moreover, as M-BERT was trained over the MLM task in other languages during its pretraining, this evaluation can be seen as a . We find that both languages do well on 1 token and 1 sign, where the correct answer is expected to be in the models' top 5 predictions for half of the instances.

The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work.

They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021).

In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining robustness of models\u2019 ability to deploy relevant context information in the face of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_para_0": "Inspired by prior works about sentence-based representations for recurrent networks Hill et al., 2016;Gan et al., 2017;Jernite et al., 2017;Logeswaran et al., 2018;Gong et al., 2016;, we seek to incorporate a more explicit hierarchy into the transformer by extending it with the capacity to learn contextualized sentence-level representations.

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

In our framework, the text and layout information are first decoupled and jointoptimized during pre-training, and then re-coupled for fine-tuning. To ensure that the two modalities have sufficient language-independent interaction, we further propose a novel bi-directional attention complementation mechanism (BiACM) to enhance the cross-modality cooperation. Moreover, we present the key point location (KPL) and crossmodal alignment identification (CAI) tasks, which are combined with the widely-used masked visual-language modeling (MVLM) to serve as our pretraining objectives. During fine-tuning, the layout flow (LiLT) can be separated and combined with the off-the-shelf pre-trained textual models (such as RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), InfoXLM (Chi et al., 2021), etc) to deal with the downstream tasks.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model.

Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_para_4": "Another stream of research for question generation is from KG to question.

First, we propose to form a query path consisting of multiple triples for question generation instead of a single triple. Second, the context we process is where the extracted triples from. This setting is more natural and different from using retrieved text as context as they did.", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_para_3": "Question Generation, aiming at generating questions from a range of inputs, such as raw text (Heilman and Smith, 2010), structured data (Serban et al., 2016) and images (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016;Fan et al., 2018a,b), has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most previous studies on textual question generation are rule-based and transform a declarative sentence into an interrogative sentence according to hand-crafted patterns (Heilman and Smith, 2010;Heilman, 2011).

In addition, following (Qu et al., 2021), we remove unanswerable questions from both datasets. OR-QuAC: This dataset has been introduced by Qu et al.

OR-CoQA: Qu et al. (2021) introduced this dataset by aggregating the CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019) dataset with the Wikipedia corpus from the OR-QuAC dataset. In contrast to OR-QuAC, the gold passages for each question are not included in the OR-CoQA dataset. Moreover, unlike OR-QuAC, there are no manually rewritten questions in the OR-CoQA dataset.

However, the efficacy of meta-learning crucially depends on the distribution of tasks available for training, and this is often assumed to be known a priori or constructed from limited supervised datasets. In this work, we aim to provide task distributions for meta-learning by considering self-supervised tasks automatically proposed from unlabeled text, to enable large-scale meta-learning in NLP. We design multiple distributions of self-supervised tasks by considering important aspects of task diversity, difficulty, type, domain, and curriculum, and investigate how they affect meta-learning performance. Our analysis shows that all these factors meaningfully alter the task distribution, some inducing significant improvements in downstream few-shot accuracy of the meta-learned models. Empirically, results on 20 downstream tasks show significant improvements in few-shot learning \u2013 adding up to +4.2% absolute accuracy (on average) to the previous unsupervised meta-learning method, and perform comparably to supervised methods on the FewRel 2.0 benchmark.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_para_6": "Meta-learning applications in NLP have yielded improvements on specific tasks (Gu et al., 2018;Han et al., 2018;Dou et al., 2019).

To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

In a real world scenario, given an arbitrary number of MT systems, one would need to evaluate them individually to find the best systems for a given language pair.

However, while zero-shot translation translates between a language pair with no parallel data, there is an assumption that both languages in the target pair have some parallel data with other languages. As such, the system can learn to process both languages. In one work, Currey and Heafield (2019) improved zero-shot translation using monolingual data on the pivot language. However, in our scenario, there is no parallel data between the low-resource language and any other language. In other work, Arivazhagan et al. (2019) showed that adding adversarial training to the encoder output could help zero shot training. We adopt a similar philosophy in our multi-task training to ensure our low-resource target is in the same latent space as the higher-resource language.", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_metadata": "Authors: Ga\u00ebl Guibon, Matthieu Labeau, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flamein, Luce Lefeuvre, C.

We mine translations from monolingual CommonCrawl data processed as described above for self-supervised MLM pretraining. After processing, there are 1.17B, 0.6B, 7.73B sentences for Chinese (zh), German (de), and English (en), respectively. LaBSE embeddings are used to pair each non-English sentence with its nearest English neighbor, dropping pairs with a similarity score < 0.6. 20 For en-de and en-zh, we train a model with Transformer-Big (Vaswani et al., 2017) in the following way: First we train the model on the mined data as is for 120k steps with batch size 10k. Then we select the best 20% using Wang  Results in table 7 show the effectiveness of the mined training data. By referencing previous results (Edunov et al., 2018), we see that the model using the en-de mined data yields performance that is only 2.8 BLEU away from performance of the best system that made use of the official WMT17 en-de parallel data. Compare to prior en-zh results (Sennrich et al., 2017), we see that our model using mined en-zh training data is as good as a WMT17 NMT model that is trained on the official WMT en-zh parallel data.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_2": "In this research, we first explore to what extent essential components of political discourse theories characterize political discussions on Reddit.

Warut Khern-am-nuai et al. [71] showed that after removing downvoting in a popular public forum, the number of both posts and replies significantly increased. Furthermore they found a decrease in toxicity and an increase in the diversity of replies. Shmargad et al. [109] demonstrated that upvoting incivility incentivized users to generate more toxic content. In a field experiment, Matias et al. [81,88] showed that hiding downvotes increased the percentage of commenters who had not been vocal on political subreddits before. On Twitter, Adelani et al. [1] demonstrated that user feedback expressed as likes and retweets significantly affected topic continuation in discussions. Stroud et al. [114] concluded that the type of feedback that users gave by pressing a button (recommend, like, respect) altered the frequency and the scope of its use (see also [115]). Focusing on Reddit, Graham et al. [53] found that indeed users rarely use the voting reaction mechanisms as community guidelines dictate. Generalizing, Hayes et al.

Specifically, we have defined a set of metrics to assess a respondent's behavior when engaging with an interview chatbot. Response Length. This metric computes the word count of a respondent's free-text response to an interview question. We chose this metric because previous work indicates that engaged respondents are more willing to give long responses [67]. Designers can use this metric to gauge their chatbot performance and to make corresponding design improvements (e.g., adding follow-up questions or changing a yes/no question to an open-ended question to elicit longer responses). Engagement Duration. This metric indicates how long a participant is willing to engage with an interview question. Although engagement duration alone does not signal the quality of user responses [67], we hope to use it as an indicator of potential issues with an interview question. For example, if the engagement duration of a particular open-ended interview question is exceedingly short, it might signal that the question is too narrow and needs to be rephrased to encourage more open and longer engagement. Completion Rate. This metric computes the percentage of participants completing an interview question or an entire interview. It is a commonly used metric to measure the effectiveness of an interviewer [7,20]. To better help designers improve their chatbots question by question (see Section 6), we compute the completion rate for each interview question (Q) by counting the number of users who completed the question ( ) and the number of users who responded to the question ( ):", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_8": "While a significant amount of collaborative practice around design in HCI orientates itself towards enabling conditions where participants can be open-minded [15], withhold judgement [56] and imagine radically different futures [14], in many respects the opposite issue is the matter of concern here.

It is often claimed that digital technologies can be \u00d2black boxes\u00d3 that are \u00d4impermeable, inflexible, and unviewable\u00d5 [37]. Indeed, consumer products are critiqued for creating conditions where these hidden innards disable people from appropriating, re-making and engaging in their own practices of design [53]. Therefore, we might take inspiration from attempts to support DIY practices around maker technologies and kits for experimentation with input and output platforms [53]. Simple tools that provide exemplar functions and types of data that act as bot \u00d2building blocks\u00d3 might offer a starting point for guided experimentation. One way of doing so might be to present already existing and typical designs that require completing (as suggested by [44]) through adding or taking away component blocks that represent specific functionality. In doing so, we might more carefully scaffold learning through safe experimentation, and also extend the current positive examples we saw where exemplar bots would be used as a starting point to inspire or ideate a new bot creation by more novice users.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_7": "As reported, there were many examples where those who were proposing bots struggled to express their ideas, could not elaborate on initial propositions, or simply had a very limited knowledge of what was technically feasible. There is potential here, however, for exploring the ways in which online environments might be designed or reconfigured to support the expression of ideas around software agents. Inspiration might be found here in literature that has examined the ways in which other online platforms support exchanges of knowledge and advice between expert and novice coders [26]. For example, Asaduzzaman et al [5] have examined why requests for help get left unresolved on platforms like StackOverflow\u00d1they highlight that those questions that are \u00d4too short, unclear, vague or hard to follow\u00d5, too specific or perceived to involve too much work often get ignored. Contrastingly, Nashei et al [38] highlight that good questions on the same platform tend to encourage continued discussion where the initial problem gets redefined. Similarly, those responses that work best tend to be those that are concise, refer back to the question asked, highlight key elements, and provide step-by-step instructions and explore multiple solutions. Furthermore, studies of expert online communities of programmers have highlighted the importance of timely responses, both from those asking a question and those proposing answers [40].", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_10": "User Satisfaction Rating. This metric is directly computed from participants' ratings of their chatbot interview experience. This rating can be easily obtained: when piloting an interview chatbot, a question like \"How satisfied are you with the interview experience?\"  [14,23] can be added at the end of an interview session for a participant to report their level of satisfaction. User Trust Rating. This metric measures participants' perceived trust in an interview chatbot. Trust is important because it affects participants' willingness to share information [37]. Similar to obtaining the user satisfaction rating, a question like \"How much do you trust this chatbot? Please rate it on a scale of 1 to 5\" can be added at the end of an interview when piloting an interview chatbot. User Sentiment. This metric evaluates participants' sentiment toward an interview chatbot since such a metric is widely used to measure user satisfaction with interviews/surveys [7]. To obtain user sentiment, one can elicit participants' rationale (why) when eliciting their satisfaction rating and trust rating during pilot interviews. Currently, we use the Vader model [16] to perform sentimental analysis on the collected users responses, and compute the percentages of positive, neutral and negative responses. Level of Empathy. This measures the level of empathy an interview chatbot has since research shows that an empathetic chatbot is able to elicit higher quality responses [65]. Currently, we compute the level of empathy by the frequency of empathetic words used by a chatbot.

Based on a year-long ethnography on the contemporary transformations in religious practices in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this paper presents how the emerging \u201cdigital\u201d cattle marketplaces subdue various forms of traditional manifestations of urban religiosity during Eid-ul-Adha, the second-largest Islamic festival in the city. This paper further depicts how such secularization contributes to diminishing rural-urban linkages, affecting electoral politics, and reducing the tolerance to religious celebrations in a city. Drawing from a rich body of work in critical urban studies, postcolonial computing, and sociology of religions, we explain how such oft-overlooked embedding of secularization in computing affects the religious fabrics in the urban regions of the Global South, and discuss its implication for HCI scholarship in diversity, inclusion, and development.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_15": "Our study builds on critical urban theories around modernism and secularism to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between HCI and religious values in an urban context. Our data show how our participants were experiencing a reduction of religious visibility, sensitivity, and performativity in diferent socioeconomic contexts of their urban lives in both the physical and online worlds. One of the popular strands of critical urban theory explains such reduction of religiosity as modernism's limitation to comprehend the complex entanglements of religion in the lives of urban dwellers. Our fndings are aligned with this line of critical work by various scholars (inter alia, AbdouMaliq Simone [123], Ara Wilson [133], Hancock [58], and Parthasarathy [108]), who critically address how scientifc tools and techniques reinforce a 'simplifed' version of urban life that is stripped of its complex religious and political relationships, and suppress the growth of alternative religion-backed modernities in urban contexts, especially in the Global South. While urban scholars are bringing religion to the disciplinary conversations to subjugate modernism's limitations, HCI is still struggling to go beyond implementing the scientifc rationalities and modernist assumptions to address the contextual needs of diferent religious groups [128]. An emerging group of scholars have started shedding light on these limitations of HCI, and providing important design implications to overcome them [73,103,113,128].Our study joins this scholarship, and argues that the existing praxis of urban HCI, urban computing, and related felds seldom address the needs of diferent religious groups, and religiosity hardly gets mediated through urban spatial, political, and socio-cultural design within HCI. We believe that this is essential to include religiosity-backed urban spatial politics in HCI conversations, which will create novel avenues of research and design for HCI and ICTD scholarship. Several HCI design paradigms including Value Sensitive Design (VSD) and Participatory Design (PD) might be useful to make designs more inclusive of religious values and practices. The contribution of this paper is not exactly about the 'process' of design, but about understanding the nature of modernity that is being extended through the use of digital tools and techniques. Thus, this paper connects HCI literature on urban HCI to a rich thread of work in social science and STS around the criticism of scientifc modernity [88], epistemic pluralism in design [51], and the appropriation of material infrastructure in urban areas [43].", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_0": "Now we bring the literature of Urban Modernity, Religion, and Urban Public Space of the Global South to the fore to better understand the embedded complexities of these contexts, where various Western digital interventions are embarking on. While modernity is marked by a set of values, processes, technologies, and the timeperiod when scientifc revolution, industrialization, and capitalism rapidly expanded across the West [128], Urban modernity is characterized by the adoption of modernist ideology in the urban built environment and as a tool to respond to emerging social and political tensions [1]. Predominantly concentrated on urban development strategies and planning policies engendered in the west, urban modernity is globally understood as a product of secular institutions, practices, and discourses [58]. A signifcant portion of knowledge in the urban studies developed in the 19th and 20th century read the cities through scientifc rationalities and measures a city's performativity through the standards of \"industrialized progress. \" [89,91,134] With the theorization of the Global City in the 1980s, this new paradigm of modern urbanism started to expand beyond the West and infuence the spatial, political, and economic readings of modern cities worldwide [116]. These scholarly and design practices reinforced the qualities of western modernity as the standards of a successful, global, modern city [58]. In the late twentieth and early twenty-frst centuries, scholars like David Harvey [62], Edward Soja [124], Saskia Sassen [116], et al. mapped the urban spatial responses around global fows of capital, technology, information and pointed toward the failures of such modernist advancement at diferent scales in an urban setting. Soja [124], Jane Jacobs [78], Fainstein [52], Sandercock [115], and many others shed light on diferent forms of social inequalities and injustices that were introduced by modern cities. Although it was not at the center of their criticism, the western concept of modernity has also always upheld the idea of secularization, and there has been a predominant secular spirit among the modernist planners or scholars toward understanding a city [31,58].", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_1": "While the twentieth-century world witnessed the advent of human rationality and technological progress, this century, by contrast, is experiencing a rise in religious/spiritual values and faith-based communities [31]. The massive globalization [123], intercontinental migrations [142], and forced mobilities of the refugees [98,109] have started to question diferent aspects of the modern secular urban planning systems of the West [31]. For the last few decades, the geopolitics of the religious have received a great deal of attention as the cities of diferent parts of the world are observing a rise in religious nationalism, fundamentalism, and communal violence [58]. Hence, in this era of globalization, religiosity is neither a unique 'feature' of the Global South, nor is there a dichotomy between the North and the South. However, since in the Global South, urban religion and the city coexist from the very beginning, scholars like Robert Orsi have suggested looking at the regional scholarly work from the Global South to understand the necessity of dynamic engagement of religion with the city [106].", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_4": "The studies mentioned above inform HCI of the need for exploring religious values, socio-cultural-religious norms, active participation of religious groups with technologies, and their evolved religious practices and lifestyles. This work, situated in an urban setting of Bangladesh, essentially represents a tension between tradition and modernity -a story that may have a resonance in many other places, too. This tension situates itself in Bangladesh through a historical trajectory of 'otherness' -while a part of this is formed by the contemporary manifestation of socio-religiosity, it is also comprised of the history of colonization, modernization, NGO-ization, and industrialization. Thus the message of this paper, in spirit, aligns with the postcolonial computing movement in HCI that critically examines the 'misplaced' and 'displaced' values through design [19,74,128].", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_14": "Our study shows how all these connections between the rural and urban regions start to disappear as online cattle markets emerge.

This paper depicts some ramifcations of such computing praxis and argues that conceptualization of the complex rural-urban linkages is essential in HCI and ICTD studies to develop more inclusive, diverse, and 'just' design strategies.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_3": "straightforward marketplace applications, and the popularity of social media platforms have made selling and buying products and services online a widely prevalent practice in the urban regions of the country [70,120,140]. Thus, a large portion of the population is actively participating in this new mode of the digital economy. Thousands of products and services are being published, promoted, and purchased over various online platforms ranging from government-developed websites to personal Facebook pages of the sellers [20,66,100]. One of the newest additions of this trend is the digitization of the 'physical' cattle markets (traditionally held in the urban areas during Eid), which has received signifcant attention in Bangladesh recently. Such transformations often engender many socio-cultural tensions and put the efort of digitizing the countries in the Global South into question. While a rich body of literature in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD), and related felds has focused on diferent aspects of digital marketplaces [36,50,59,101], very few studies have been conducted in the context of the Global South [42,104,131]. Hence, how these digital marketplaces impact various cultural dimensions there, has hardly appeared in HCI literature. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the digitization of cattle markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and report its multi-faceted impacts on the social, cultural, and political dimensions of urban Bangladesh.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_2": "Next, we turn to urban spatials to explain why, in the global south, it is difcult to understand urban religion without taking space and spatial politics seriously. Various scholarly works conducted in South Asian and African cities demonstrate several forms of complex yet inevitable engagements among urban religion, spaces, and functions. For instance, AbdouMaliq Simone has examined how the traditional Islamic institution \"zawiyyah\" helps urban Africans to act efectively within a larger globalized economic domain [123]. Zawiyyah provides space and a trans-local network through which marginalized urban entrepreneurs or businessmen can connect, react to, or resist the globalized urban world. Through examples of urban violence, such as the Godhra Station incident and riot in Ahmedabad in 2002, Yasmeen Arif has reported how rehabilitative religious activities take control over urban space, when 'secular' or state-sponsored eforts fail [28]. Similarly, through her ethnographic work, Ara Wilson has demonstrated how multiple vernacular economic systems sustain in Bangkok's global economic setting as the religious shrines invade and disrupt the mobilities of capital and labor [133]. Parthasarathy has taken this further by exploring the spatial politicization of religion in urban Mumbai during the religious festival Chhat Puja [108]. With similar spirit around religious festivals, Mehrotra et al. explain how, during Kumbh Mela, a kinetic city emerges in India and challenges the very necessity of permanency in defning the urban [96]. Taken together, this line of work clearly shows the urgency of studying spatial manifestations of urban religion since religion cannot be seen as peripheral or even antithetical to the urban modernities and civic futures of cities in the global south, which is gradually embracing various digital interventions.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_9": "We conducted the second phase of our study (February 2020-August 2020) remotely amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

This phase included (i) analyzing design details of digital haat websites (both governmental and non-governmental), (ii) observing and documenting comments, conversations, and debates on Facebook pages that were used as online trading platforms for cattle heads, (iii) conducting 15 semi-structured phone-interviews with online cattle sellers (6, men, 21-45 yrs old, 5 received formal education) and buyers (6 men, 3 women, age ranged from 25 to 53 yrs, working individuals). We approached our participants through our social network. Interviews were 20-30 minutes long and focused on the participants' experience around digital selling/shopping of Qurbani animals. We primarily selected the websites and Facebook pages we studied based on the recommendations of our interview participants. Later, from the comment sections of those Facebook pages, we came to know about more pages and websites, which were selling Qurbani animals during Eid ul Adha in 2020 2 . We kept studying the websites and Facebook pages until our study reached a theoretical saturation [107].", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_13": "We also argue that the design, development, and deployment of online marketplace need to be analyzed with respect to the seller's and consumer's relative positions in the broader non-secular political contexts, where needed. For instance, social media technologies (Instagram, Facebook pages, Lives, etc.) for promoting and selling commodities online should provide multi-modal options through which sellers can more actively engage with the market system without any fear of being judged or ridiculed. Designs similar to IVR Junctions [132], text-free user interfaces [95], and CGNet Swara [94] can support the farmers with limited digital literacy to participate actively in the market system. Cutting-edge AR and VR technologies have made signifcant progress in providing the users with some sort of 'tacit' feeling of an object remotely and developing empathy [22,61,64]. Similar technologies could be extended to allow religious communities to interact with the cattle sellers in a more intimate way. In addition, these online marketplaces should allow people to choose and buy religious commodities collectively (instead of its existing mode of 'individual buying'), when needed. Such technologies may help growing communal bonds which these communities value. Moreover, our fndings point toward the emergence of a new working group in the process of the digitization of cattle markets-the digital middleman (who collects sacrifcial animals from rural areas and delivers to urban buyers' houses or simply help the farmers to post advertisements of their cattle heads online). Proper integration of such services in design and development phases is essential to ensure the market system's overall permanence. Finally, more involvement of local government and political leaders in the online digital space should be ensured as well.", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_3": "More recently, researchers have examined workplace collaboration in a wider variety of settings. Colbert et al. [13] noted that \"digital fluency\" (a level of proficiency with digital technology that allows someone to achieve strategic goals) is a core competency of the modern workforce, and that technology has blurred the lines between work and nonwork domains. Jarrahi [32], Hemsley [29], Lee [40], and others have documented the processes and communications of \"digital nomads\" -people who are geographically mobile and work remotely, and who have formed online communities to network and share information. Sutherland and Jarrahi note their similarity of digital nomads' knowledge networks and cobbled-together tech and social practices to those of gig workers for ride-sharing apps or odd-job marketplaces [59]. Sawyer [56], Erickson and Jarrahi [17] describe the layers of both technical and social knowledge that modern workers must draw on as \"infrastructural competence,\" a form of bricolage [43] in which people apply any resources at hand in their given work conditions or contexts toward the desired goals.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_12": "We argue that to make online marketplaces more diverse, inclusive, and sustainable, we must include the values and sentiments from religious groups in the design and development phases. For instance, in this case of online cattle markets, such inclusion should essentially be achieved by incorporating the religious sentiments of all the actors involved in various phases of Eid ul Adha's religious ritual (ranging from cattle production to sacrifce). As mentioned in our fndings, farmers raising sacrifcial animals should be provided with digital facilities that support them to express their spiritual attachment with their animals while making a sale online. Religious sentiments of the buyers should also be incorporated while designing such marketplaces to avoid doubts and spiritual dissatisfactions we documented in our feld study. The information needed for a product to sell online (i.e., images, description, review, price, etc.) should be carefully screened and published so that the users' personal beliefs or religious sentiments are not hurt. In other words, the transition, translation, or transformation of a physical marketplace into an online marketplace is an essential mode of this design, but that cannot be done at the expense of the religiosity that these communities hold high. Borrowing from Chandra et al.s' analysis of the digitization of informal marketplaces in the Global South [42], we also suggest that cultural practices (for instance, clientalization, bargaining, and testing) of a physical marketplace should be incorporated in the online market in a meaningful way to make the designs sustainable. Moreover, scholars and practitioners from diferent religious backgrounds should be involved in designing the framework of digital marketplaces to help defning the materiality of such online platforms. They can provide important suggestions on which products or commodities can be sold online and how, without hampering their religious signifcance. Such 'religious' transformation is still largely missing in digital marketplace design.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_11": "The cattle heads raised to sell for Qurbani (sacrifce) attain a religious value as per Islamic tradition. Hence, the sacrifcial animals are raised under the farmers' maximum supervision, handled and transported with care, provided with good quality food and medicine (if needed). The religious value of these animals gets transferred from the rural cattle seller to urban Muslim buyer as they interact at urban haats. Cattle head buyers continue to take care of their sacrifcial animals till the Eid day, which is considered as one of many religious instructions of this ritual. The majority of our rural participants complained that online cattle marketplaces fail to apprehend the religious value of a sacrifcial animal and quantifes each animal by some numerical terms, for example, price, live weight, height, and amount of meat can be processed out of it. This phenomenon sidelines the religious signifcance of a sacrifcial animal and converts it into a regular product available in online marketplaces.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_0": "Peer production is a powerful example of the potential of social computing in which communities like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM)-the 'Wikipedia of Maps' [32,73]create high-quality content at previously unimaginable scales.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations. We tuned the dimensionality of the embedding from the pool {100, 150, 200} and the number of vMF mixture components from the pool {200, 500, 800}.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_6": "In this section, we describe the word embedding results, where we directly compare our model with the following baselines: GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), Skipgram (Mikolov et al., 2013b) (denoted as SG), Continuous Bag of Words (Mikolov et al., 2013b) (denoted as CBOW), and the recently proposed WeMAP model (Jameel et al., 2019).

These vectors are normally learned such that they are predictive of some word co-occurrence statistic, but they are otherwise unconstrained. However, the words from a given language can be organized in various natural groupings, such as syntactic word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs) and semantic themes (e.g. sports, politics, sentiment). Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors. We show that this results in word vectors which are qualitatively different from those obtained with existing word embedding models.

We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks.

Note that documents are still modelled as multinomial distributions of topics in these models. In (He et al., 2017) the opposite approach is taken: documents and topics are represented as vectors, with the aim of modelling topic correlations in an efficient way, while each topic is represented as a multinomial distribution over words. In this paper, we take a different approach for learning document vectors, by not considering any documentspecific topic distribution.

Surprisingly, we observe our models performs well on 30+ Tatoeba languages for which we have no explicit monolingual or bilingual training data. Finally, our embeddings perform competitively on the SentEval sentence embedding transfer learning benchmark (Conneau and Kiela, 2018).", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

We use the French Treebank from the SPMRL 2014 shared task (Seddah et al., 2014) with its provided splits for our French experiments.

In the case of the French Treebank, we also include 50-dimensional embeddings of each morphological tag. We use automatically predicted tags for training and testing, obtaining predicted part-ofspeech tags for the Penn Treebank using the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) with 10-way jackknifing, and using the provided predicted partof-speech and morphological tags for the French Treebank.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain. Finally, we also perform a thorough investigation of our system performances, providing insights and pinpointing the reasons behind our improvements via a fine-grained evaluation on different label-frequency classes.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_para_1": "One popular extension to the SAN is to revise attention distribution by static and dynamic biases.

Following GENRE standard practice, we use the last encoder output for the representation of each token and a simple linear layer on top of it to compute the start and end tokens probability distributions.

Instead of drawing distanceaware dependencies like recurrent neural network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and convolutional neural network (Kim, 2014), SAN captures short-and long-range relations between elements. SAN involves all signals with a weighted averaging operation, which may incorporate too many unrelated elements to concentrates on specific relations. Recent work has modified SAN to enhance specific relation learning. For example, in (Shen et al., 2018), a directional self-attention network (DiSAN) uses one to multiple positional masks to model the asymmetric attention between two elements and capture context-aware relations for all tokens.  modeled the local information by revising the attention distribution with a learnable Gaussian bias to focus on neighboring relations.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_abstract": "The problem of rare and unknown words is an important issue that can potentially influence the performance of many NLP systems, including both the traditional count-based and the deep learning models.

More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%.

A telic event includes a natural endpoint (\u201cshe walked home\u201d), while an atelic event does not (\u201cshe walked around\u201d). Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work. We also create a new data set of English texts manually annotated with telicity.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

We match the score of Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer Base (T5 BASE ) (Raffel et al., 2020), a state-of-theart model that uses BERT BASE hyperparameters, while using only half the parameters, shorter training (3/8 tokens overall), and a fraction (1/37) of the data compared to T5.

However, most existing related models can only deal with the document data of specific language(s) (typically English) included in the pre-training collection, which is extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_metadata": "Authors: Shan Randhawa, Tallal Ahmad, Jay Chen, Agha Ali Raza | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

While this paper does not test academic theories of collective action or social movements, it does gesture toward ways that its qualitative and quantitative findings can relate to these theories. A substantial quantitative research tradition has asked what factors come together for a collective action such as a decision or political action to occur or be successful [60,16]. When explaining a protest or strike, political opportunity theories would focus on the nature of the grievances of movement actors, expecting that those with greater grievances would be more likely to take action [55]. Political opportunity theories would also emphasize network relations among movement actors as important factors in joining a social movement [52]. Resource mobilization theories would focus on group resources as important factors in social movement mobilization, as well as the relative isolation of a group from other participating social movement groups [53].", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_metadata": "Authors: Tingting Liu, Xiaotong Li, Chen Bao, M.

Bezel Check crosses the same bezel of tablets twice. In contrast, B2B-Swipe utilizes the short distances among the four bezels of smartwatches. Bezel Menus [8] explored different bezel-initiated marking menu layouts for eyes-free interaction on small mobile devices.

Among them, the most similar to B2B-Swipe were developed by G\u00e1bor and Fiener [4], who proposed an input method using a bezel as a tactile landmark for interaction that allows the user to perform eyes-free input. Similarly, B2B-Swipe uses the bezels of a rectangular smartwatch as tactile landmarks so that the user can specify the start bezel without looking at the smartwatch. Some work has used sensors other than the touch screen to realize eyes-free input methods. For example, WatchIt [16] embedded touch sensors within a watchband and allowed the user to perform swiping and tapping on the band; Pasquero et al. [15] used Hall-effect sensors and a force sensor that enable the user to perform various eyes-free gestures, including covering the watch's face and turning the watch's bezel.

Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20]. Nonetheless, our techniques require wearing multiple rings to track the motions of secondary fingers, which may be somewhat impractical for some users. This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements. For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_abstract": "In this paper, we present Touch+Finger, a new interaction technique that augments touch input with multi-finger gestures for rich and expressive interaction. The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \"idle\" fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_metadata": "Authors: Jiahuan Zheng, Xin Peng, Jiacheng Yang, Huaqian Cai, Gang Huang, Ying Zhang, Wenyun Zhao | Venue: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work | Year: 2017 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_8": "To track the motion of secondary fingers in the air, the ring-like device prototypes were worn on the thumb and the index finger. We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_9": "Finding clips and re-ranking videos.

Finegrained analyses of users' gesture articulations are also possible to understand how users vary their gestures relative to each other and relative to recognizers' canonical template forms [65,66]. Also, gesture recognition algorithms have been using many gesture features, such as path length, articulation time, or average speed [8,52], that can be repurposed as gesture performance measures to evaluate users' gesture articulations [51,68]. However, most of these measures, although useful for gesture classification, lack descriptive power for gesture analysis because they focus on the global characteristics of a gesture as a whole. In contrast, the Gesture RElative Accuracy Toolkit (GREAT) [65], which we employ in this work, enables access to fine-grained measurements on the gesture path that reveal and help understand the subtleties of users' gesture articulations. More specifically, the GREAT measures describe the many ways in which gestures unfold in time, space, stroke structure, and appearance, characterizing gesture articulations in terms of their closeness to a reference form, analogous to MacKenzie et al.'s accuracy measures for pointing tasks [31].", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_13": "Interesting future work directions may look at the applicability of synthesizing data across user populations for mouse input [15,17,33], voice input [21,29], whole-body movement [53,62,63], and even EEG input [25,56]. While all these directions are definitely interesting, they are nevertheless challenging, but worth exploring in order to advance our theoretical and practical knowledge of simulating input data across different user populations toward better interface designs for users will all abilities. Looking forward, we believe that our work already forms a good demonstration of how simulation can be used to refine the gesture design process within HCI and accessibility research and we are eager to see how the community will pick up these ideas and use them for other application areas.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

Where co-design with teachers is reported in HCI, this has been used in a number of contexts such as in the creation of a layered story-telling approach to analytics [55], in exploring wearables for classroom orchestration [74], the co-design of computing curricula at K-12 [98], as well as for the creation of immersive experiences for collective inquiry [53]. While these papers all report on studies that resulted in artefacts that were successfully aligned with classroom practices as a result of co-design processes, the papers themselves primarily focus on the evaluation of these artefacts within their given context. As such, there is less of a focus on specific insights into ways researchers can support the teacher to take ownership of these technologies and integrate them into their practices.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_abstract": "Educational technologies offer benefits in the classroom but there are barriers to their successful integration, including teachers\u2019 pedagogical beliefs and their skills and experience. Participatory Design (PD) approaches offer one way in which teachers can be directly involved in the design of classroom technologies, however PD processes alone fail to address the challenges of integrating technology within existing practices. In this paper we propose co-teaching as a novel form of co-design practice. We describe a two year longitudinal Co-Teaching project resulting in the development and use of three digital designs for the classroom. Using the TPACK model to guide our reflections we offer insights into the ways that co-teaching can support the design and integration of educational technologies. We suggest that co-teaching as a form of co-design practice offers a way to move teachers from passive adopters of technology to active participants in the design and integration of educational technologies.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_8": "Participatory and co-design approaches have a long history in HCI [83,84] given its particular focus on the role of human-centered design practices. Participatory Action Research (PAR) is one participatory approach to research that specifically seeks to bring about change [50]. It is deeply rooted in practice and is often seen as a commitment to observe and problematize social enquiry through practice [57], one which is 'democratic, collaborative, and interdisciplinary' [31]. Although sharing several of the same commitments to including participants in the research process, co-design differs in its specific focus on design-led practices with the aim of co-designing an artefact.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_14": "In this paper we conceptualize co-teaching as a form of design practice and suggest it as a suitable method for the design of educational technology. Co-teaching, through its embedded and situated approach to design and evaluation, offers the potential to reduce some of the known tensions within co-design practices in the classroom. It offers a method of design practice specifically for use in the educational technology field and as such is a suitable method to consider the unique challenges of designing technology for the classroom. Alongside ensuring teachers remain active in the design process, we suggest it also offers a potential way of supporting the development of teachers' (and arguably designers') TPACK, something known to support integration of educational technology in the classroom [30]. Co-design as a design practice specifically encourages collaboration between stakeholders with a particular emphasis on the sharing of relevant expertise. The user is positioned as an expert of their experience while the researcher or designer offers tools for ideation as well as technological knowledge [83]. Co-teaching, meanwhile is traditionally a term used to define the practice of two teachers working collaboratively to teach a class and is often used as a method of teacher training e.g. [37,77]. It facilitates the creation of student-centered environments as well as supporting successful school improvement programs through its focus on collaborative reflection and action [61]. Roth & Tobin suggest that co-teaching as a practice offers the opportunity for 'co-generative dialogue', a term to define the collaborative reflection on praxis Teaching Implementing the design in the context.

Roschelle et al. suggest that key considerations for co-designing with teachers include creating a \"concrete, tangible innovation challenge\", investigating \"current practice and classroom contexts\", and involving \"central accountability for the quality of the products of the co-design\" [80]. One area where co-design with teachers is becoming more prevalent and methods are often discussed explicitly is in the learning analytics field, specifically with a renewed interest in the application of human-centered design approaches to the design of learning analytics tools, e.g., [2,35,58,99].", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_metadata": "Authors: Motohiro Makiguchi, Daisuke Sakamoto, H.

Approaches in HCI such as design research that focus on the active involvement of the user in the design of systems offer ways to engage teachers in the design of educational technologies that better align with their practices and beliefs. Participatory, and co-design, approaches specifically ensure teachers are involved [80] and have been shown to have substantial effects on the adoption of tools designed [20] as well as encouraging curriculum innovation and technology implementation [70]. There are, however, relatively few instances in HCI literature of teachers participating in co-design processes, with literature more often reporting engagement with students or parents [51]. Studies that do use co-design methodologies with teachers, often primarily consider their involvement in the early stages of the research to gather ideas through workshops and other ideation activities rather than throughout the process, e.g., [51,99], or more commonly report on evaluations of the artefact created rather than the process, e.g., [3,53,55,74,98].

Kling provided rich insights on the \"cooperative\" and \"collaborative\" nature of social computing and the need to tie design, use, and technological impact together among stakeholders [66]. CSCW, HCI and ICT have historically had a relationship with participatory design (PD) and innovation-related programs and policymaking by specific political concerns [62,[65][66][67]122]. Jackson et al. [62] recognized that there is a disconnection among research, design, and practice in the field of CSCW and argued for a holistic orientation, proposing an interconnected \"knot model\" (among design, use, and collaboration with organizations within public policy systems) with a focus on policy, practice, and design. The role of policy design was also investigated by Jackson and colleagues, [63] who emphasized the need for collaboration and mutual learning between scientific study and policy to successfully navigate design, infrastructure, and organizational collaboration complexities. They highlighted that traditional CSCW is more focused on \"implication for design\" than \"implication for policy\" in regard to ambitions of long-term social impact. Similarly, Freeman et al. (2017) [42] pointed out the scarcity of empirical studies between design and policy contexts in HCI and CSCW.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_metadata": "Authors: Nusrat Jahan Mim | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_metadata": "Authors: M.

It is known, however, that teachers' pedagogical practices and beliefs can often vary between their espoused beliefs and enacted practices [22,54], highlighting the critical need to explore both teachers' espoused and enacted beliefs and practices. Longitudinal co-design processes that include teachers in the design and evaluation of educational technologies in the classroom are one way that this could be explored. There are however some well-reported tensions in the co-design process when used in an educational setting. For example, teachers and designers often have different criteria for evaluating the success of co-design processes [88]. Teachers often see researchers' solutions as too theoretical and not suited to real life classrooms [22,54] while researchers often view teachers' limited knowledge of technology as a barrier to effectively contributing to design processes [88], which points to a need for more engaged and embedded design practices. It is clear from previous literature that successful co-design requires teachers to feel their ideas are respected and that there is an \"atmosphere of trust and inclusion\" in co-design partnerships [13]. The use of 'traditional' co-design in educational technology, despite careful consideration of teachers' pedagogies and the design of the resulting artefact, has still not been able to address all of the challenges of long-term integration of educational technology in the classroom.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_metadata": "Authors: Sebastian Deterding | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science, Psychology | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_metadata": "Authors: Shaomei Wu, Lindsay Reynolds, Xian Li, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2019 | Fields: Psychology, Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_metadata": "Authors: Filip \u0160kola, F.

Utilizing co-teaching as a method in this project allowed the researcher to understand the impact of context on teachers' enacted practices and how these differed from the ones described at the beginning of the design process.

In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, it is seen as a means of empowering people, providing affordable and customisable technology with potential to enrich areas such as education or assistive technology. To investigate this alleged potential, we performed an anthropological inquiry at an elementary school for disabled children that lasted one year, participating in everyday activities with students, teachers, and therapists. We observed \u2018heterogeneity in a fluid environment\u2019 and \u2018creativity in the moment\u2019 in an \u2018endemically underfunded\u2019 setting.

The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59]. This paradox was at the heart of this paper, exploring the potential of DIY approaches in a school for disabled children.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_5": "The complex multi-sectoral nature of high-level decision making and the institutions that form these decision networks can be further understood through the concept of institutioning. Institutioning refers to working within diverse institutions [36], and is a useful frame for understanding the complexity within community-based design processes, particularly when conducting a program with a participatory design (PD) [114,115]. These scenarios are characterized as situations in which the process is constantly moving horizontally and vertically between and within diverse micro-meso and macro levels [58] and call for attention to the significant relationships between policy, institutions, and meta-cultural frames [58,115]. PD approaches in social computing are figured by a diverse group of institutions, and need to be understood in terms of the meso-and macro-level institutions that PD is dependent on and informed by [58]. Dearden and colleagues [33] also acknowledged the need to understand the institutioning involved in critical computing issues. In the debate on HCI and social innovation, they also contribute to the insufficiently studied issue of HCI designers' lack of attention past the research context to how innovations become distributed and adopted for social goods. Political issues surrounding technology, such as how decisions are made for technology adoption and scale-up in programs may be understood through the complexities of institutioning and the actors at the decision-making level [114,115], where these institutions and their individuals are broadly influenced by their own objectives and priorities, yet have to translate initiatives between designers and communities [25,26].", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_8": "These contributions are targeted to the agendas of Human-Computer Integration [21,22] due to the insights resulting from studying peripheral awareness as a mechanism of integration; Trustable and Explainable AI [52], due to the tactics offered to promote trust when designing integration systems that can automatically act on the experience; and Inbodied Design, due to the focus on the internal bodily processes to inform HCI design [5,57].", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

From earlier research on the use of and barriers to DIY technologies, we already learned about the challenges with respect to efort expectancy and the lack of facilitating conditions [77], the lack of alignment with clinical practice [37], the time-consuming process of confguration and adding content due to openness of DIY toolkits [52], and the lack of representation of end-users in the design [11], resulting in design for others [56]. Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_13": "Moreover, decades of work in Participatory Design (PD) has been advocating for such inclusion of all stakeholders; in fact, there have been a plethora of examples in HCI of local government bodies being included in designing projects of public interest. Through configuring the role of intermediation and understanding how an artefact is shaped, embraced, and used in the real world, PD in HCI can improve its approach to effective social innovations [25]. We want to emphasize that we advocate taking this strategy further. We do not only mean having some policymakers around the table along with other stakeholders to make the design more democratic, but also that they need to design for the challenges that policymakers face and involve local people in designing solutions for those problems. For example, as our data shows, policymakers are often tempted to deploy digital applications because there is external pressure from donors and the government but that have little use in the community. We suggest that this problem also be brought to the table when doing such as designing a nutrition program with the local community. A grassroots-level movement, for example, may create a nationwide awareness against such unjustified pressure to deploy digital technologies. We are excited about the potential of various HCI interventions that have allowed local people to voice such concerns in the Global South [11,81,84,121,122], and we believe that such technologies might be useful in addressing the problems at the top to help make a bottom-up design successful.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_2": "This study contributes to HCI by advancing our understanding and explicating some nuances of self-initiated individual smartphone use in co-present interactions.

Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75]. By analyzing naturally occurring interactions, this study seeks to identify issues with existing defnitions of phubbing and ofers a new conceptualization for future research.

Thus, conversational technology will not only impact their current self but also their future adult-self. However, what if instead of being shaped by CUIs that are designed by adults, children would shape their future and that of CUIs through conversations? How could CUIs be turned into 'DIY', 'bottom-up' critical technology shaped by children, in order to nurture children's refections about futures? 4.1.1 Approach. To turn CUIs into a vessel of future-focused conversations for children, we explored critical and co-design inspired methods attuned to children's development. We adapted a co-design method developed in the child-robot interaction feld: PeerPlay, Perspective Taking in Embodied Role-Play [87,89]. This method was developed by Zaga et al.

Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]). However, this individualistic perspective overlooks how students, teachers and therapists are afected by the organisations within which they operate, and which in turn are impacted on a societal level, thereby risking to undermine ongoing processes of empowerment.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting"}}

As not all contexts and desired behaviors are equally suited for gamification, \"extending the use of gamification beyond these contexts, and systematically studying the moderating effects of different individual and situational contexts is thus very much in need today\". The authors argue that \"we are just at the beginning of understanding what gamification design elements and methods best map onto what application domains\".

After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak.

Following our initial expectation that gamification in a professional scientific context is most likely to profit from a serious, informative and rule-based design language, we created the Rational-Informative Design (RID) that provides information expected to appeal to HEP researchers. The RID was designed to make less use of most common game elements like points and leaderboards. Instead, it uses elements of \"Social networks\", \"Social discovery\", \"Signposting\" and \"Challenges\" (the LHC collaboration goal on the dashboard) as suggested by Tondello et al. [41]. This enables an exploration of gameful design elements in the HEP context. Yet, as scientists are already subjected to a high degree of competition, we also created a contrasting Simple Game Elements Design (SGED) version that focuses on point-based rewards and competitive elements. The basic UI design rules (color scheme, arrangements, etc.) are the same for both versions and are inspired by the actual service design. We built interactive wireframes with a high level of detail using the prototyping tool Balsamiq. As it is impractical to develop two functional, productive designs for the purpose of studying perceptions, we decided in favor of fully interactive prototypes. This approach is also motivated by recent, novel research methods, mapping persuasive strategies to gamification user types based on storyboards [34].", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_2": "We developed and evaluated two gamification prototypes that are inspired by an existing High Energy Physics (HEP) research preservation service.

These scenarios are characterized as situations in which the process is constantly moving horizontally and vertically between and within diverse micro-meso and macro levels [58] and call for attention to the significant relationships between policy, institutions, and meta-cultural frames [58,115]. PD approaches in social computing are figured by a diverse group of institutions, and need to be understood in terms of the meso-and macro-level institutions that PD is dependent on and informed by [58]. Dearden and colleagues [33] also acknowledged the need to understand the institutioning involved in critical computing issues. In the debate on HCI and social innovation, they also contribute to the insufficiently studied issue of HCI designers' lack of attention past the research context to how innovations become distributed and adopted for social goods. Political issues surrounding technology, such as how decisions are made for technology adoption and scale-up in programs may be understood through the complexities of institutioning and the actors at the decision-making level [114,115], where these institutions and their individuals are broadly influenced by their own objectives and priorities, yet have to translate initiatives between designers and communities [25,26].", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_para_11": "Dominant structures are difcult to outgrow.

Other domains where human centered design approaches have made contributions include education [64], sustainability [65], personal informatics [38], mental health [34], and accessibility [8]. Through taking a broader perspective of problems and focusing on the experiences of people most impacted by the problem, HCD can open avenues for multiple kinds of insights and solutions into complex design challenges.

Our work differs from this line of work in three key aspects: (1) Input: SUPPLE and its descendants require functional specifications as input. This is beneficial for application developers as they only need to specify what functions are exposed to users. On the contrary, our work targets UI designers who already have some ideas about desired layouts. It enables designers to define the design task by demonstration, including element types, and preferences regarding size and placement. (2) Layouting: When rendering an interface layout, SUPPLE used three heuristics to sequentially decide the layout -bottom-up, top-down, and minimum remaining values [22]. The key objective was to find a layout that satisfies user preferences, abilities, and device constraints. In contrast, our MILP formulation aims at constructing well-formed grid layouts, with desirable aesthetics, by considering the entire composition of the canvas.

This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings.

From earlier research on the use of and barriers to DIY technologies, we already learned about the challenges with respect to efort expectancy and the lack of facilitating conditions [77], the lack of alignment with clinical practice [37], the time-consuming process of confguration and adding content due to openness of DIY toolkits [52], and the lack of representation of end-users in the design [11], resulting in design for others [56]. Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts"}}

However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_0": "Stance detection aims to automatically identify one's opinionated standpoint/attitude (e.g. Pro, Con, or Neutral, etc.) expressed in text towards a specific proposition, topic, or target (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Augenstein et al., 2016;Mohammad et al., 2016;Sobhani et al., 2017).

Distributing data using a single property creates a histogram, whereas distributing data using two properties creates a 2D scatter plot with the added option to view a 3D histogram. Data that is distributed along three properties creates a 3D scatter plot. Jeffery can use this action to explore the distribution of different properties, for example, by year. The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions. While this dataset is dominated by Western cinema, there seems to be quite a few movies from South Asia as well.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_para_0": "Siegel and McKeown (2000, henceforth SMK2000) present the first machine-learning based approach to identifying completedness, i.e., telicity, determining whether an event reaches a culmination or completion point at which a new state is introduced. Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours. Other related work on predicting aspect include systems aiming at identifying lexical aspect (Siegel and McKeown, 2000;Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) or habituals (Mathew and Katz, 2009;Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015).", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_metadata": "Authors: Justin Matejka, Michael Glueck, Tovi Grossman, G.

Understanding the digital transformation that SMBs in Africa went through during the pandemic can play an important role in uncovering how to build solutions that better support the African business and African worker. In this paper we report on findings from a qualitative study with 40 SMBs in Kenya. The study aimed to understand the lived experience of digital transformation, the impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses, and how they responded to such impacts using technology. We found that COVID-prompted digital transformation was reactive and opportunistic, plus social and collective. Moreover, the socialness of business goes way beyond digital transformation, and influences how SMBs in Kenya start, develop and are sustained. In illustrating this, we offer a lens to understanding work and workers of SMBs in Kenya and similar contexts across the globe.", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_para_1": "In this paper, we report on the findings from an interview study with SMBs in Kenya that sought to understand their lived experience of digital transformation over the course of the pandemic. We elucidate how SMBs in Kenya adapted to the impact of COVID-19, and in particular, how technology was employed to assist in addressing the challenges of this period. Research has evidenced that the COVID-19 pandemic was not only a health crisis, but also prompted widespread technological disruption [7]. This phenomenon was reflected in our research through the widespread digital transformation of SMBs. However, the majority of the technologies adopted were not designed with the African business in mind. Rather they were designed in and for the Global North. Research shows that just porting such technologies from one setting -with its specific orientations and concerns -to another setting is not always effective nor beneficial [8][9][10][11]. If we wish to enable digital transformation which enhances productivity among businesses in Africa, it is important to design with the opportunities and contingencies of work in Africa in mind. This research is a step in this direction, providing a rich understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the digital transformation of SMBs in Kenya.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_13": "This paper makes two main contributions.

Limitations of ecological validity, scalability, and generalizability of findings pose a significant challenge for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which ultimately need to function in any context, on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce MYND: An open-source framework that couples consumer-grade recording hardware with an easy-to-use application for the unsupervised evaluation of BCI control strategies. Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording, and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires at home. As a use case, thirty subjects evaluated two BCI control strategies \"Positive memories\" and \"Music imagery\" by using a four-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) with MYND. Neural activity in both control strategies could be decoded with an average offline accuracy of 68.5% and 64.0% across all days.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_3": "Choice of laboratory-based BCI control strategies. We utilized a set of stimulus-free two-task BCI control strategies that were previously evaluated in laboratory experiments with healthy subjects. The control strategies have shown to be immediately executable by subjects without the need for prior training, and they are unrelated to motor processes, which limits accidental movement artifacts. Most importantly, they induce modulation of neural activity in broad areas of the cortex, which could make them particularly suitable for use with consumer-grade EEG equipment with few sensors. We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4]. Now, we complement the laboratory results with MYND to investigate whether these strategies can be executed in an uncontrolled, realistic environment, by utilizing a consumer-grade EEG, and if repeated execution affects performance.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_7": "Control strategy evaluation. With this study, we aim to evaluate how well the BCI control strategies can be performed in an uncontrolled, realistic setting and consumer-grade hardware, outside of the laboratory. The small amount of trials scheduled per day (18 to 36), recorded with a consumer-grade EEG, makes it challenging to learn a good decoding model per subject, day, and strategy. To solve this problem, we leveraged the information obtained from previous laboratory trials with a transfer-learning approach ( [39], toolbox available online 6 , additional details in [11]). Here, a linear regression model for each subject in the at-home study is learned while regularizing the regression weights with a Gaussian prior that is learned on existing laboratory data.

In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy.

On the other hand, we found a high variation of daily accuracies within subjects. The consumer-grade EEG and our fitting algorithm allowed subjects to record neural data quickly, but the hardware may also pose new challenges for the BCI user: Even when perfectly fitted, the dry sensors at distant ends of the scalp may require users to induce strong, consistent modulations in neural activity in order to be reliably detected. As one potential mediator, meditation experience may affect the ability to maintain focus in unsupervised environments [27]. However, in a post-hoc analysis, we found that self-reported meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies in this study. On the other hand, daily motivational scores correlate positively with accuracy in this study. Therefore, using the MYND platform to combine easily accessible control strategies with motivating, daily feedback could further improve performance and help with more consistent execution. This feedback will need to be robust to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and higher susceptibility to involuntary head-muscle artifacts around the ears and the forehead, where the sensors are located. As one promising approach to implement robust feedback, concurrent work in [28] explored an adaptive signal-filtering method that relies on signal-variation, similar to the fitting algorithm presented here. Providing immediately accessible daily decoding scores could be implemented on the device by utilizing prior information from higher quality laboratory data via transfer-learning, as shown in this offline analysis.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

While all these directions are definitely interesting, they are nevertheless challenging, but worth exploring in order to advance our theoretical and practical knowledge of simulating input data across different user populations toward better interface designs for users will all abilities. Looking forward, we believe that our work already forms a good demonstration of how simulation can be used to refine the gesture design process within HCI and accessibility research and we are eager to see how the community will pick up these ideas and use them for other application areas. CONCLUSION We presented a principled method to generate gesture samples for people with visual impairments using gestures collected from people without visual impairments. Our method is based on the foundations of the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements and its associated Sigma-Lognormal model. The software implementing our method is publicly available at https://g3.prhlt.upv.es, while the gestures dataset can be downloaded from http://www.eed.usv.ro/~vatavu.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_metadata": "Authors: Wenjian Huang, T.

In particular, we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence-table cloze questions, which we release for future research. \u2022 We evaluate PASTA, which is DeBER-TaV3 pre-trained with our table-operations aware pre-training approach, on two widelyadopted table-based fact verification benchmark datasets, TabFact (Chen et al., 2020a) and SEM-TAB-FACTS (Wang et al., 2021b ", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_abstract": "Fact verification has attracted a lot of attention recently, e.g., in journalism, marketing, and policymaking, as misinformation and dis- information can sway one\u2019s opinion and affect one\u2019s actions. While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_4": "ProgVGAT  integrates programs and execution into a natural language inference model. This method uses a verbalization with a program execution model to accumulate evidences and constructs a graph attention network to combine various evidences. Tapas (Herzig et al., 2020) extends BERT with additional structure-aware positional embeddings to represent the tables. Eisenschlos et al., 2020 further pre-train Tapas on counterfactually-augmented and grammar-based synthetic statements. Schlichtkrull et al., 2021 study table-based fact verification in an open-domain setting, and combine a TF-IDF retrieval model with a RoBERTabased joint reranking-and-verification model. Tapex  guides the pre-trained BART model to mimic an SQL executor via an execution-centric table pre-training approach. The pre-training corpus of Tapex is synthesized via sampling SQL queries from the SQUALL dataset (Shi et al., 2020). SaMoE (Zhou et al., 2022) develops a mixtureof-experts network based on the RoBERTa-large model (Liu et al., 2019). The MoE network consists of different experts, and then a management module decides the contribution of each expert network to the verification result.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim.

We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_3": "Our experiments adopt the popular three-stage pipeline of FEVER task, comprising document selection, evidence sentence extraction, and claim verification (Thorne et al., 2018b).

Benefiting from designing various effective self-supervised learning objectives, such as masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2018), PLMs can effectively capture the syntax and semantics in text to generate informative language representations for downstream NLP tasks. However, conventional pre-training objectives do not explicitly model relational facts, which frequently distribute in text and are crucial for understanding the whole text. To address this issue, some recent studies attempt to improve PLMs to better understand relations between entities (Soares et al., Peng et al., 2020). However, they mainly focus on within-sentence relations in isolation, ignoring the understanding of entities, and the interactions among multiple entities at document level, whose relation understanding involves complex reasoning patterns. According to the statistics on a human-annotated corpus sampled from Wikipedia documents by Yao et al. (2019), at least 40.7% relational facts require to be extracted from multiple sentences. Specifically, we show an example in Figure 1, to understand that \"Guadalajara is located in Mexico\", we need to consider the following clues jointly: (i) \"Mexico\" is the country of \"Culiac\u00e1n\" from sentence 1; (ii) \"Culiac\u00e1n\" is a rail junction lo-cated on \"Panamerican Highway\" from sentence 6; (iii) \"Panamerican Highway\" connects to \"Guadalajara\" from sentence 6.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours.

In this work, we develop the concept of the Workplace Playbook VR to investigate how virtual reality (VR) can help autistic people develop their work-related social communication skills in partnership with people in their support network. Using a video prototype to present the concept, we interviewed 28 participants, including 10 autistic people and 18 members of their support networks, which included family members and professionals.

Several researchers have investigated how VR technologies support autistic individuals to acquire employment skills [14,21]. Employment skills can be divided into two broad categories: job-specific skills called hard skills (e.g., folding, photocopying, and sweeping), and more generic employment-related skills called soft skills (e.g., time management, social skills, and interview skills) [98]. Prior technology-related studies focused more on hard skills rather than soft skills [15], even though autistic people often experience more challenges at work due to their soft skills [33]. Social situations that may arise at work (e.g., working with co-workers, managing conflict, dealing with office politics) have been identified as major challenges that autistic people face in the workplace [65]. Although some studies investigate the use of VR to develop autistic people's soft skills, many focus on learning skills for job interviews such as how to properly communicate and respond in interview situations (e.g., emotional regulatory strategies and self-advocacy methods), use non-verbal communication (e.g., eye contact) when interviewing, and manage attire or hygiene when preparing for an interview [41,64,89,93], rather than on skills related to navigating social situations associated with ongoing employment (e.g., having lunch with co-workers and working with customers). While interview skills are important for obtaining employment, more contextualized and practical support for the everyday social encounters of autistic people in workplaces would further advance their work experience, satisfaction, and success.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_abstract": "Virtual reality has recently been adopted for use within the domain of visual analytics because it can provide users with an endless workspace within which they can be actively engaged and use their spatial reasoning skills for data analysis. However, virtual worlds need to utilize layouts and organizational schemes that are meaningful to the user and beneficial for data analysis. This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

Following our initial expectation that gamification in a professional scientific context is most likely to profit from a serious, informative and rule-based design language, we created the Rational-Informative Design (RID) that provides information expected to appeal to HEP researchers. The RID was designed to make less use of most common game elements like points and leaderboards. Instead, it uses elements of \"Social networks\", \"Social discovery\", \"Signposting\" and \"Challenges\" (the LHC collaboration goal on the dashboard) as suggested by Tondello et al. [41]. This enables an exploration of gameful design elements in the HEP context. Yet, as scientists are already subjected to a high degree of competition, we also created a contrasting Simple Game Elements Design (SGED) version that focuses on point-based rewards and competitive elements. The basic UI design rules (color scheme, arrangements, etc.) are the same for both versions and are inspired by the actual service design. We built interactive wireframes with a high level of detail using the prototyping tool Balsamiq. As it is impractical to develop two functional, productive designs for the purpose of studying perceptions, we decided in favor of fully interactive prototypes. This approach is also motivated by recent, novel research methods, mapping persuasive strategies to gamification user types based on storyboards [34].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_5": "Despite the promising results of previous studies, limitations on VR interventions for autistic people have also been reported [30,47,68]. While previous studies found VR intervention to be effective when acquiring daily living skills [47,63,78], a recent meta-review study pointed out that VR had moderate effects on improving communication skills and emotion regulation skills, perhaps due to the complicated and nuanced nature of these skills [47]. Regarding methodological rigor, results of VR intervention studies are often difficult to validate and generalize due to substantial variations among autistic individuals [40,43,68]. Furthermore, the lack of sufficient precedent and theoretical guidance for VR intervention design and the fact that actual users were not sufficiently involved in the design process were pointed out as limitations [30,68]. This critical view emphasized the importance of understanding the characteristics, needs, and preferences of autistic individuals and stakeholders when designing VR experiences for them [68]. Thus, our research aims to improve the understanding of how VR experiences should be designed to enhance social and communication skills by involving autistic people and members of their support networks in the early stages of VR design.

Simple tools that provide exemplar functions and types of data that act as bot \u00d2building blocks\u00d3 might offer a starting point for guided experimentation. One way of doing so might be to present already existing and typical designs that require completing (as suggested by [44]) through adding or taking away component blocks that represent specific functionality.

To maintain these steps, many systems model a workflow as a graph where nodes represent application states and edges represent actions used to transition between two states [12]. For instance, Image Graphs [20] used a graph structure to spatially visualize one's workflow during image creation, where a node was an image and an edge was an operation to transform one image into another.

[9] called for future research to push the importance of rethinking the way autism is perceived, thus emphasizing the use of words that promote respect and an accurate understanding of autistic people. Researchers have re-conceptualized autism as neurodiversity [27,87], contesting the understanding of independent living or the concept of autonomy. A central premise of neurodiversity is to support self-advocacy and personal autonomy in autistic individuals, allowing them to exert more control over their own lives [51]. To achieve autonomy, one must have functional communication, so any intervention promoting neurodiversity should provide opportunities to express agency and-more importantly-build effective and respectful communication between autistic persons and others in their environment [51]. The concept of agency can be used as an effective framework to understand the social interactions between neurodiverse communication facilitators [79].", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_4": "Take away: HCI Practitioners can re-use the implementation description and the code offered along with the equipment listed to study changes in the user's field of view via EEG in real-time during interaction.

As such, we invite HCI practitioners to use peripheral awareness as a neurological state to better understand how we can support human performance in other areas within HCI, such as: health and wellbeing, critical systems, sports, and creative and collaborative work, to name just a few. Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance.

However, talking about it, seeking medical help when necessary as well as examining oneself in order to 'know' oneself is complicated by social-cultural constructions of the vagina, i.e. it is something private, shameful and not to be talked about. In response to this, we designed Labella, an augmented system that supports intimate bodily knowledge and pelvic fitness in women. It combines a pair of underwear and a mobile phone as a tool for embodied intimate self-discovery. In this paper, we describe Labella, and its evaluation with fourteen women, aged 25-63. We show how through situated embodied perception Labella empowers 'looking'.

We developed Labella as a tool for use by women, which provides a unique perspective on women's pelvic fitness.

Awkward learning, as discussed previously, combines 'weird funny' and 'weird not funny', challenging weirdness as prohibitive although helpful in breaking awkwardness. Avoiding problematic knowledge or feeling self-conscious contributes to inhibit discussion. Moreover, laughter makes the conversation more accessible and puts people at ease therefore contributing to the social component of the interaction required to talk about bodies that are 'funny' and look 'kind of weird'. Alexandra relates how amusing situations and humorous products can contribute to get the message across:  [8,17,21]. With Labella, we bring these topics forward and explore how digital technologies can be harnessed in support of managing embarrassment and sexuality in self-care and care of others in these intimate spaces [25]. In the following sections we outline how embodied interactions inform looking to promote learning about hidden parts of the body. We discuss how learning is awkward when applied to sensitive and intimate topics, but that such awkward learning can be facilitated by humour.

Similarly, the giggly and funny experience of interacting with Labella provides both psychological and physical ease to look at and understand the self, sometimes for the first time. In addition, the technology provides a (physical and digital) space in which looking at oneself is acceptable (the app suggests so) and legitimate (research). Moreover, women's accounts of the body being \"weird\" or \"funny\" seek to strengthen the notion that humorous interactions within the body can be advantageous to encourage conversations and breaking taboos. In this regard, interactions that incorporate humour in design have the possibility to support awkward learning, which may be charged with not only physical or social but also emotional stigma and taboo.

In conclusion of their literature research on tactile consciousness, Gallace and Spence (2008) [18] claim that conscious perception of touch is inseparably dependent on the processing of more general (specifically, spatial) information in the brain. Tactile perception is largely dependent on the integration of information from multiple senses. This is in line with the study discovering that observing a video with a hand being touched during the reception of tactile stimuli on own hand enhances the sensory threshold [53]. Moreover, just observing touch on other human body can be 'felt'. In [28], it was found that touch observation activates the somatosensory areas in the brain. Indeed, humans posses such 'tactile empathy' that allows them to experience illusory tactile sensations while seeing other persons being touched. Interestingly, this ability can become over-active in some individuals, resulting in visually-induced tactile synaesthesia [4].", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_para_3": "Visual analogue scales (VASs) have a history of use in psychology, psychiatry, and healthcare, to measure a range of subjective experiences, such as mood, depression, pain, and physical exertion [23].

In 1923 Freyd discussed the broader application of the technique in the field of psychology, providing heuristic guidelines for visual appearance [10]. VASs have traditionally been displayed on paper, with their key advantages over other techniques being that they can be self-administered with little training, and provide extremely sensitive (granular) measurement. Their disadvantages have traditionally been that they are visual, cannot be administered aurally, and take longer to encode (measure/transcribe). However, when administered on a computer, the measuring step can be automated, making VASs a viable alternative to discrete Likert scales. Software tools allow for the automatic creation and encoding of VASs [23,31] generating a renewed interest in VASs.

We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA.

Our work uses linear probes as a method to identify the function of groups of neurons that are correlated with linguistic and tasklevel features, rather than for interpretation of individual neurons.

There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters.", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_para_3": "During the past decade, deep learning methods became the mainstream for document understanding tasks (Yang et al., 2017;Augusto Borges Oliveira et al., 2017;Siegel et al., 2018).

GNN-based approaches (Liu et al., 2019a;Yu et al., 2021;Tang et al., 2021) adopted multi-modal features of text segments as nodes to model the document graph, and used graph neural networks to propagate information between neighboring nodes to attain a richer representation.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_0": "This method, which can be applied simply in a purely post-hoc analysis, independent of the training process, can enable both understanding of individual models and comparison across models. The interpretation process enables investigation of which identified functional groups correspond to linguistic or task level heuristics that may be employed in well understood non-neural methods for performing the task. Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models.

By contrast, the approach we have described here continues a recent line of work on direct modeling of correlations in the input space, by using rich feature representations to parameterize local potentials that interact with a comparatively unconstrained structured decoder. As noted in the introduction, this class of feature-based tree scoring functions can be implemented with either a linear transition system (Chen and Manning, 2014) or a global decoder (Finkel et al., 2008).

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image.

However, most existing related models can only deal with the document data of specific language(s) (typically English) included in the pre-training collection, which is extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure. Code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/jpWang/LiLT.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_abstract": "The paper presents a first attempt towards unsupervised neural text simplification that relies only on unlabeled text corpora. The core framework is composed of a shared encoder and a pair of attentional-decoders, crucially assisted by discrimination-based losses and denoising. The framework is trained using unlabeled text collected from en-Wikipedia dump. Our analysis (both quantitative and qualitative involving human evaluators) on public test data shows that the proposed model can perform text-simplification at both lexical and syntactic levels, competitive to existing supervised methods. It also outperforms viable unsupervised baselines. Adding a few labeled pairs helps improve the performance further.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_abstract": "While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_abstract": "The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence.

We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA.
