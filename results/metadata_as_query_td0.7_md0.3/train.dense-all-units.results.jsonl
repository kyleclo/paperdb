Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).",

Although there are guidelines [36,37] that provide best practices for authoring alt text descriptions, researchers have found that these practices are often poorly suited for describing people who appear in images due to the complexities of representing gender, race, and disability [3]. Researchers have also noted that one-size-fts-all image descriptions are inadequate for addressing the information preferences of blind and low vision people, which necessitates the need for contextually relevant image descriptions [27,28]. Context can be particularly important when determining how to describe images of people, as research by Bennet et al. [3] identifed six contexts where additional appearance descriptions could be benefcial. Due to the vital role alt texts play in providing access to visual content, and the importance of profle pictures as expressions of users' identities online, it is important to further our understanding of how context impacts what screen reader users want to know about profle pictures, and how they prefer that information to be conveyed.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank"}}

Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. We explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence, where the evidence for each candidate is based on a small set of strong relations, rather than relations to all other entities in the document. The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain. Finally, we also perform a thorough investigation of our system performances, providing insights and pinpointing the reasons behind our improvements via a fine-grained evaluation on different label-frequency classes.", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding"}}

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept.

We address a new application of attention, and introduce a significantly different attention mechanism, which allows each variable to focus on multiple objects. We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy. The documents are partitioned into train, test-a and test-b. Like most authors, we report performance on the 231 test-b documents with 4483 linkable mentions.", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_metadata": "Authors: Bin Liang, Qinglin Zhu, Xiang Li, Min Yang, Lin Gui, Yulan He, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent pieces of evidence, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidence as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_metadata": "Authors: Haejun Lee, Drew A.

To enable computational modeling of news structures, we apply an existing theory of functional discourse structure for news articles that revolves around the main event and create a human-annotated corpus of 802 documents spanning over four domains and three media sources. Next, we propose several document-level neural-network models to automatically construct news content structures. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating system predicted news structures yields new state-of-the-art performance for event coreference resolution.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

This paper proposes a new multi-axis modeling to better capture the temporal structure of events. In addition, we identify that event end-points are a major source of confusion in annotation, so we also propose to annotate TempRels based on start-points only. A pilot expert annotation effort using the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in IAA from the conventional 60\u2019s to 80\u2019s (Cohen\u2019s Kappa). This better-defined annotation scheme further enables the use of crowdsourcing to alleviate the labor intensity for each annotator.

On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled.

After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak.

EMA research has shown that self-harm engagement is preceded by an increase in negative emotions and followed by a decrease in these same emotions (e.g., [3,6]), lending empirical support to theories that conceptualise self-harm as a form of emotional regulation [43] through a physical 'release' of pain.

Das et al. (2017a) proposed a visual dialog task in which a conversational agent attempts to answer questions regarding an assigned image based on a dialog history. To approach this task, they initially collected data by having two people chat about an image with one person acting as the questioner and the other as the answerer. GuessWhich (Chattopadhyay et al., 2017) extends VisDial with the goal to build an agent that learns how to identify a target image through question and answers. (de Vries et al., 2016) additionally introduced a game in which a series of yes-or-no questions are asked by an agent in order to locate an object in an image. Many researchers approached these tasks via reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of obtaining an optimal dialog policy. Zhang et al. (2017), for example, designed three rewards with respect to the goals of task achievement, efficiency, and question informativeness, in order to help the agent to achieve an effective question generation policy for GuessWhat game. Das et al. (2017b) applies reinforcement learning in the GuessWhich task and demonstrates a moderate improvement in accuracy compared to the supervised learning approach. Both methods apply RL on a neural end-to-end pipeline to jointly influence the language generation and dialog policy. Due the challenge of designing an appropriate reward for language generation, these methods generate responses that deviate from human natural language. Zhang et al. (2018), proposed an approach involving hierarchical reinforcement learning and state-adaptation techniques that enable the agent to learn an optimal and efficient multi-modal policy. The bottleneck of (Zhang et al., 2018)'s method, however, is that the system response is retrieved from a predefined humanwritten or system-generated utterance. The number of predefined responses are limited, therefore, this method does not easily generalize to other tasks in real-world settings. We address these limitations by applying RL on a reduced, yet more relevant action space, while optimizing the dialog generator in a supervised fashion. We alternatively optimize policy learning to language generation to combine the two tasks together.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach to learn an optimal dialog policy for task-oriented visual dialog systems. A common practice is to apply RL on a neural sequence-to-sequence(seq2seq) framework with the action space being the output vocabulary in the decoder. However, it is difficult to design a reward function that can achieve a balance between learning an effective policy and generating a natural dialog response. This paper proposes a novel framework that alternatively trains a RL policy for image guessing and a supervised seq2seq model to improve dialog generation quality. We evaluate our framework on the GuessWhich task and the framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both task completion and dialog quality.", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_para_1": "Dialogue generation is an important research topic in NLP, thus many approaches have been proposed to address this task. Most earlier works made use of a predefined template (Lemon et al., 2006;Wang and Lemon, 2013) to generate dialogues. More recently, deep neural networks have been used for building end-to-end architectures capable of generating questions (Vinyals and Le, 2015;Sordoni et al., 2015) and also for the task of goal-oriented dialogue generation (Rajendran et al., 2018;Bordes et al., 2017). Visual dialogue focuses on having a conversation about an image with either one or both of the agents being a machine. Since its inception (Das et al., 2017), different approaches have been proposed to address this problem (Massiceti et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2017;Das et al., 2017). Goaloriented Visual Dialogue, on the other hand, is an area that has only been introduced fairly recently. De Vries et al.  proposed the GuessWhat?! dataset for goal-oriented visual dialogue while Strub et al.  developed a reinforcement learning approach for Figure 2: A block diagram of our model. The framework is trained on top of three individual models: the questioner (QGen), the guesser, and the oracle. The guesser returns an object distribution given a history of question-answer pairs that are generated by the questioner and the oracle respectively. These distributions are used for calculating the information gain of the question-answer pair. The information gain and distribution of probabilities given by the Guesser are used either as a reward or optimized as a loss function with global rewards for training the questioner.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

Visual referring expression recognition (REF) is the task of identifying the object in an image that is referred to by a natural language expression (Mao et al., 2016;Kazemzadeh et al., 2014). Datasets containing real images and expressions such as RefCOCO+ (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014) and Ref-COCOg (Mao et al., 2016) have been proposed to evaluate the progress on this task. Multi-modal transformers (Lu et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019;Tan and Bansal, 2019), using pretrain-then-transfer approach, have shown superior performance on these datasets. However, these models fail to learn robust visio-linguistic contextual representations and are shown to exploit the imbalanced distribution in the train and test splits (Akula et al., 2020a;Cirik et al., 2018). Recently, CLEVR-Ref+ (Liu et al., 2019) has been introduced as a synthetic diagnostic benchmark that allows control over dataset bias. There are nearly 0.8M referring expressions of which 32% of expressions refer to only a single object (Single-referent) and 68% refer to more than one object (Multi-referent). In this paper, we refer to the full dataset as F-Ref and the single-referent subset as S-Ref.

In order to build a traditional modular-based dialog system, researchers first identify the semantic representation, such as the dialog acts and slots in user utterances. Then they accumulate these semantic representations over time to track the dialog state. Finally they apply RL to learn an optimized dialog policy given the dialog state (Raux et al., 2005;Shi and Yu, 2018). Such modular-based dialog systems are effective in narrow task domains, such as searching a bus route schedule and reserving a restaurant through natural language, but they fail to generalize to complex settings where the size of the action space increases. Owing to the development of deep learning, RL on neural sequence-to-sequence models has been explored in more complex dialog domains such as open-domain conversation (Li et al., 2016) and negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017). However, due to the difficulty of assigning appropriate rewards when operating in a large action space, these frameworks cannot generate fluent dialog utterances. Zhao et al. (2019) proposed a novel latent action RL framework to marry the advantage of a module based approach and sequence-to-sequence approach. They learned the optimal dialog policy in a complex task-oriented dialog domain while achieving decent conversation quality. We study the similar issue in a multimodal task-oriented dialog scenario. We propose an iterative approach to optimize dialog policy using RL methods and system response generation via SL.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_abstract": "The ability to engage in goal-oriented conversations has allowed humans to gain knowledge, reduce uncertainty, and perform tasks more efficiently. Artificial agents, however, are still far behind humans in having goal-driven conversations. In this work, we focus on the task of goal-oriented visual dialogue, aiming to automatically generate a series of questions about an image with a single objective. This task is challenging since these questions must not only be consistent with a strategy to achieve a goal, but also consider the contextual information in the image. We propose an end-to-end goal-oriented visual dialogue system, that combines reinforcement learning with regularized information gain. Unlike previous approaches that have been proposed for the task, our work is motivated by the Rational Speech Act framework, which models the process of human inquiry to reach a goal. We test the two versions of our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset, obtaining significant results that outperform the current state-of-the-art models in the task of generating questions to find an undisclosed object in an image.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

More specifically, our focus lies on how humans come up with a series of questions in order to reach a particular goal. One popular theory suggests that humans try to maximize the expected regularized information gain while asking questions (Hawkins et al., 2015;Coenen et al., 2017). Motivated by that, we evaluate the utility of using information gain for goal-oriented visual question generation with a reinforcement learning paradigm. In this paper, we propose two different approaches for training an end-to-end architecture: first, a novel reward function that is a trade-off between the expected information gain of a question and the cost of asking it; and second, a loss function that uses regularized information gain with a step-based reward function. Our architecture is able to generate goal-oriented questions without using any prior templates. Our experiments are performed on the GuessWhat?! dataset , a standard dataset for goal-oriented visual dialogue that focuses on identifying an undisclosed object in the image through a series of questions.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_9": "Luke is always smiling and does not easily give up.

Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

In this paper, we propose a joint contrastive learning (JointCL) framework, which consists of stance contrastive learning and target-aware prototypical graph contrastive learning. Specifically, a stance contrastive learning strategy is employed to better generalize stance features for unseen targets. Further, we build a prototypical graph for each instance to learn the target-based representation, in which the prototypes are deployed as a bridge to share the graph structures between the known targets and the unseen ones. Then a novel target-aware prototypical graph contrastive learning strategy is devised to generalize the reasoning ability of target-based stance representations to the unseen targets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ZSSD task.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_2": "Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stance for destination unseen targets by learning stance features from known targets (Allaway and McKeown, 2020).

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model.

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_metadata": "Authors: Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Roberto Navigli | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

Early work transfers between modern English and the Shakespeare style with a phrase-based machine translation system (Xu et al., 2012). Recently, style transfer is more recognized as a controllable text generation problem (Hu et al., 2017), where the style may be designated as sentiment (Fu et al., 2018), tense (Hu et al., 2017), or even general syntax (Bao et al., 2019;. In the above approaches, the training sentences are labeled with style information, but no parallel data are given. Xu et al. (2019a) take one step further and capture the most salient style by detecting global variance in a purely unsupervised manner (i.e., style labels are unknown).", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_6": "Attention models have shown great promise in several applications, including machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014) and image caption generation (Xu et al., 2015). We address a new application of attention, and introduce a significantly different attention mechanism, which allows each variable to focus on multiple objects. We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b)."}}

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_metadata": "Authors: James Fiacco, Samridhi Choudhary, C.

On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled.

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_3": "For training our system, we created an unlabeled dataset of simple and complex sentences by partitioning the standard en-wikipedia dump. Since partitioning requires a metric for measuring text simpleness we categorize sentences based on their 4 https://github.com/subramanyamdvss/UnsupNTS  (Flesch, 1948). Sentences with lower FE values (up to 10) are categorized as complex and sentences with FE values greater than 70 are categorized as simple 5 . The FE bounds are decided through trial and error through manual inspection of the categorized sentences. Table 1 shows dataset statistics. Even though the dataset was created with some level of human mediation, the manual effort is insignificant compared to that needed to create a parallel corpus. To train the system with minimal supervision (Section 4.5), we extract 10, 000 pairs of sentences from various datasets such as Wikipedia-SimpleWikipedia dataset introduced in Hwang et al. (2015) and the Split-Rephrase dataset by Narayan et al. (2017) 6 . The Wikipedia-SimpleWikipedia was filtered following Nisioi et al. (2017) and 4000 examples were randomly picked from the filtered set. From the Split-Rephrase dataset, examples containing one compound/complex sentence at the source side and two simple sentences at the target side were selected and 6000 examples were randomly picked from the selected set. The Split-Rephrase dataset is used to promote sentence splitting in the proposed system."}}

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

For example, Blake and Mouton proposed five methods to handle conflicts: forcing, withdrawing, smoothing, compromising, and problem solving [7].

Our results show that, compared to giving explanations or social encouragement, providing concrete suggestions is the most effective way to manage conflict. Based on this finding, we suggest existing communities should educate members to try to understand the intent of the contributors and provide constructive suggestions when conflicts occur. The online collaboration systems should also support flexible interfaces for members to conveniently provide suggestions. In Wikipedia, newcomers' edits are often reverted without any further information. According to Halfaker's paper [17], this might be a cause of the slower growth of Wikipedia's editor base. They then proposed a tool to present newcomers' activity traces to Wikipedian mentors, and this information significantly helped mentors to provide more explanations about edit reverts [18]. However, our results suggest that tools should be designed to support not just providing explanations but also giving constructive suggestions for solving the problem in order to retain good-faith contributors.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_para_1": "Conflicts generally have negative effects on group loyalty, work productivity, and job satisfaction [10,19,21].

This can lead to negative emotions such as feelings of disappointment, frustration, annoyance and anger, which also cause contributors to leave the community. Unlike traditional organizations, contributors of online collaboration projects have no formal employment or membership contacts with the community, so they can easily leave the communities with few social or economic consequences.

For example, Joode et al. found that both task conflict and affective conflict can occur in open source communities, especially when a contributor's software patch was unjustly rejected [41].", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

Conflicts are especially common in the peer review process, in which people decide whether one's contributions should be accepted or not [42]. There are different forms of peer review in different online collaboration settings. In many software development projects, there is a formal peer review system where contributors propose code changes (e.g., pull-requests in GitHub) and reviewers decide whether the contribution should be accepted or not [40]. In Wikipedia, both formal peer review and informal peer review exists. For instance, featured articles (FA) are determined by a formal peer review process where group of editors decide whether candidate articles should be promoted to FA or not [1]. Additionally, any edit on Wikipedia articles could be viewed as being informally \"peer reviewed\" [37]. On most unprotected pages, any editors can \"review\" others' edits. If they don't like the edits, they can reject them by reverting or overwriting on them. In this paper, we focus on formal peer review systems where there are explicit roles like reviewers and submitters (which we refer as contributors in the following sections), and dedicated places to submit the review, discuss the review decision. Particularly, we examine what happens when the submitter openly disagrees with the reviewers (i.e., conflicts occur).", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

It is a wellknown online open collaboration platform [11], which is widely used to host open-source software projects. Through GitHub, a large number of developers can effectively collaborate to build open-source software. As of early 2015, GitHub has supported 9.1 million developers collaborating across 21.5 million code repositories [2]. GitHub has a peer review mechanism to ensure that any peer developers' code changes must be confirmed as valuable, secure and efficient before merging them into the code repositories. In this process, issues like competing technologies, incompatible software versions, and information overload can often cause conflicts [15]. Besides, most archival data of the hosted projects are publicly available through GitHub's official API [3].

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

Colnago et al. [14] documented the attitudes and behaviors surrounding twofactor authentication (2FA) as it was rolled out at a large research university. Regarding account sharing, the authors found that 2FA interfered with the ability of some students to share their financial accounts with parents, because the parents could only use the shared password at a time when the students were available to answer the 2FA push notification. They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities.

The rules around social distancing, controlled mobilities, and other health regulations gave an impetus to the growing digital haat scenario in Bangladesh during Eid-ul-Adha in 2020.Hence, we essentially focused on documenting these digital marketplaces' impacts on urban Dhaka and beyond in the second phase of our study. This phase included (i) analyzing design details of digital haat websites (both governmental and non-governmental), (ii) observing and documenting comments, conversations, and debates on Facebook pages that were used as online trading platforms for cattle heads, (iii) conducting 15 semi-structured phone-interviews with online cattle sellers (6, men, 21-45 yrs old, 5 received formal education) and buyers (6 men, 3 women, age ranged from 25 to 53 yrs, working individuals). We approached our participants through our social network. Interviews were 20-30 minutes long and focused on the participants' experience around digital selling/shopping of Qurbani animals. We primarily selected the websites and Facebook pages we studied based on the recommendations of our interview participants.

This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_13": "This paper makes two main contributions.

Partly driven by a political mandate to engage youth explicitly as part of their digital innovation strategy, our participants argued for leveraging youth potential, seeing them as agents of change. This a priori interest in youth engagement signifies how decisionmakers think of population segments, which will be key in successful innovation diffusion. Notably, this is not limited only to creating youth-friendly applications or creating \"lite\" youth versions of apps aimed at adults. Youth are traditionally construed as \"human becomings,\" \"denigrating their present lives, while focusing only on the adults they will become\" [7]. For decision-makers, the youth of today have an essential role to play in Bangladesh's digital innovation narrative in the present. This is also a strategic decision when it is considered that 40% of the country's population is under the age of 18, a phenomenon that is not exclusive to Bangladesh [104]. The UK's leading development institute, ODI, argues that since the world now has the largest generation aged 15-24 in history (and 90% of these youth live in Global South countries), a unique opportunity is afforded to development practitioners and theorists. There is \"a one-time window of opportunity for a concerted international effort to help developing countries reap a 'demographic dividend' from educated, healthy and gainfully employed young women and men, and achieve far higher economic growth rates\" [96]. However, we also urge caution here and advise that any attempts to mediate youth engagement with decision-makers needs to be carried out with the utmost care. Though ostensibly motivated by youth empowerment, authorities as well as non-state actors have repeatedly sought to disrupt spaces for youth participation or co-opt them towards their own political agendas. Moreover, if development projects consider youth perspectives and motivations for development, they can be included in initiatives whose primary target populations are adults. For instance, when targeting information dissemination to women farmers, we should consider young people's role as change-makers in farming communities. Hence, we recommend that every national and regional development context has population segments that are prioritized for innovation roll-out due to factors such as high early adoption rates or alignment with national agendas. When configuring projects, we recommend that HCI researchers consider how their projects will leverage these population segments to maximize their impact.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection"}}

In particular, we achieve a 20% relative reduction in error from Chisholm and Hachey (2015) on CoNLL, and a 22% error reduction from Cucerzan (2012) on TAC 2012.

In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining robustness of models\u2019 ability to deploy relevant context information in the face of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_1": "Most ER systems consist of a mention model, a context model, and a coherence model (Milne and Witten, 2008;Cucerzan, 2007;Ratinov et al., * Currently at Tel Aviv University \u2020 Currently at IIT Bombay 2011; Hoffart et al., 2011;Hachey et al., 2013). The mention model associates each entity with its possible textual representations (also known as aliases or surface forms). The context model helps resolve an ambiguous mention using textual features extracted from the surrounding context. The coherence model, the focus of this work, encourages all mentions to resolve to entities that are related to each other.

When a magnetic sheet is thin enough, the capacitive sensor of the touch device can detect the user's finger behind the magnetic sheet due to the sheet's dielectric behavior. Furthermore, by changing the magnetic pattern of the magnetic sheet using a handy magnetizing tool, the tactile feedback can be customized within seconds. Since the construction of the interface is so simple, this method enables users to customize not only the size and shape, also the haptic feedback of the tangible interface. We demonstrated several types of interface such as buttons, sliders, switches, and cross-keys.", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_para_1": "For customizability, magnetic forces have been used for various haptic technologies. Bump Ahead [Yasu and Katsumoto. 2015] and Mechamagnets [Zheng and Do. 2018] presented designability of the tactile interface using permanent magnetic. For customizing haptic feedback, Polymagnet [Correlated Magnetics. 2016] and Magnetic Plotter has developed a machine for computational magnetization of permanent magnets and showed the way of haptic design. Meanwhile, our approach shows that magnetization can be done even without machines. The handy magnetizer can write and rewrite the magnetic patterns rapidly, and the haptic feedback can be modified stronger, weaker, or almost null until the desired haptic feeling is achieved. This is a rapid-designing method of haptic feelings.

Today, a virtual haptic technology that uses vibration to convey the click feeling is used at a practical level [Fukumoto andSugimura. 2001, Kim andLee. 2013]. The user can customize the strength of the feedback configuring the vibration. However, it is not suitable for presenting where the button is, or what the shape of the button is. For those matters, it seems smarter to use a Tangible User Interface. The capacitive sensors of the touch device can be used for recognition of the position, size, and orientation of the passive objects [Chan et al. 2012]. However, it is hard to customize the haptic feedback because most approaches use the elasticity or rigidity of the passive material itself.", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_metadata": "Authors: Maitraye Das, Brent J.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_metadata": "Authors: R.

Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_metadata": "Authors: E.

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

Based on prior work on touch gesture techniques [7,32] and touch interaction periods [5,33], the two main factors we considered in our design space were touch gesture and interaction period.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_6": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use kinetic feedback for peripheral awareness integration over mechanisms such as screen notifications, sounds, and haptics, because the user can remain attentive to the experience, rather than having to switch their attention to receive feedback via other sensory inputs, which, in turn, could affect the integration experience. This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_2": "The literature on designing accessible touch interfaces for people with visual impairments has focused significantly on applications and interaction techniques [7,10,44], while studies on how people with visual impairments use touch input or articulate gestures have been scarce. Nevertheless, the studies that exist have reported valuable and useful data. For example, Kane et al. [23] showed that blind people prefer gestures that use an edge or a corner of the device and Buzzi et al. [11,12] reported preferences for round-shaped gestures, one-finger input, one-stroke gestures, and short trajectories. Detailed examination of gesture articulation paths [23] showed that blind people produce touch gestures that are different in size, speed, number of strokes, and gesture shape than the gestures produced by sighted people. Our work looks in more depth at the differences between gestures articulated by people with and without visual impairments by considering the new perspective of the velocity profiles of the hand producing touch gestures in the context of the formalism of the Kinematic Theory [46].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_metadata": "Authors: Mari Tyllinen, J.

SideSight [3] provides virtual, multi-touch interactions around the body of a small mobile device, using infrared (IR) proximity sensors. SideSwipe [35] also leverages the unmodified global system for mobile communication (GSM) signal to enable in-air hand gestures above and at the side of a mobile device. Arefin Shimon et. al., [1] explored hand gestures above a smartwatch in order to overcome the limited interaction space of the small screen. More recently, hovering interactions above the screen [12] have been found to allow for richer and more expressive interactions by identifying the user's intention before a touch event occurs. Much research Session 7: Sensing in the Small Scale UIST 2018, October 14-17, 2018, Berlin, Germany has been conducted on using the back of a mobile device [26] or handheld device [34] as a possible input space. This extended space enables a variety of multi-finger gestures beyond the touchscreen, providing far richer interactions. However, expanding the interaction space beyond the touchscreen may sacrifice some of the benefits of direct-touch interactions (e.g., increased time for selecting a target and better performance in pointing tasks [16]). Therefore, we seek to combine touch and in-air gestures to maximize the benefits of modality and expressivity.", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_metadata": "Authors: Wenjian Huang, T.

Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20]. Nonetheless, our techniques require wearing multiple rings to track the motions of secondary fingers, which may be somewhat impractical for some users. This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements. For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_5": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use changes in a user's field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a mechanism for integration. We suggest that they should consider how the integration system extends the user's abilities in the contexts of the experience. Using EEG to monitor neural activity can offer access to a user's preattentive processing state, resulting in possibilities for integration where the system responds to a situation \"before\" the user can with their body. This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_metadata": "Authors: Iuliia Avgustis | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_metadata": "Authors: Jiahuan Zheng, Xin Peng, Jiacheng Yang, Huaqian Cai, Gang Huang, Ying Zhang, Wenyun Zhao | Venue: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work | Year: 2017 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference"}}

After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_abstract": "A common task for scatterplots is communicating trends in bivariate data. However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

In this paper, we explore possible uses of gamification to support reproducible practices. Past efforts attempted to stimulate good scientific practices through open science badges. They have been shown to significantly impact research data sharing practices of publications in the Psychological Science journal [28]. Yet, little empirical knowledge exists on the moderating effects of individual gamification mechanisms in professional scientific settings. In fact, it has recently been argued that mapping the impact of game design elements on specific domains is indeed much needed in gamification research today [31].", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_2": "We developed and evaluated two gamification prototypes that are inspired by an existing High Energy Physics (HEP) research preservation service. Both aim to stimulate research documentation and sharing. A series of research activities informed the designs: we reviewed field studies, conducted interviews and observed a workshop, to learn about physicists' needs and perceptions towards the service. This approach is in line with increasing evidence that meaningful gamification profits from in-depth knowledge of target users [11,19], and calls to consider unique characteristics and frameworks of scientists in scientific gamification design [23].", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_abstract": "The need for data preservation and reproducible research is widely recognized in the scientific community. Yet, researchers often struggle to find the motivation to contribute to data repositories and to use tools that foster reproducibility. In this paper, we explore possible uses of gamification to support reproducible practices in High Energy Physics. To understand how gamification can be effective in research tools, we participated in a workshop and performed interviews with data analysts. We then designed two interactive prototypes of a research preservation service that use contrasting gamification strategies. The evaluation of the prototypes showed that gamification needs to address core scientific challenges, in particular the fair reflection of quality and individual contribution. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes which describe perceptions and requirements of gamification in research: Contribution, Metrics, Applications and Scientific practice. Based on these, we discuss design implications for gamification in science.", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_4": "In Rethinking Gamification [24], Deterding stresses that \"motivational design should revolve around designing whole systems for motivational affordances, not adding elements with presumed-determined motivational effects. \" In The Maturing of Gamification Research, recently published by Nacke and Deterding [31], the authors highlight that gamification's early research focused on few contexts, like education. As not all contexts and desired behaviors are equally suited for gamification, \"extending the use of gamification beyond these contexts, and systematically studying the moderating effects of different individual and situational contexts is thus very much in need today\". The authors argue that \"we are just at the beginning of understanding what gamification design elements and methods best map onto what application domains\". Recent work from Orji, Tondello and Nacke [34] represents a good example, mapping impact of persuasive strategies on gamification user types for persuasive gameful health systems. Basing their study on storyboards, they illustrate how gamification research profits from novel methods.

We prepared a few questions for every principal view that aimed to stimulate feedback. Following the design exploration, we asked the physicists to respond to a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire, structured as follows: \u2022 An abbreviated Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) scale was used, as it provides two valuable subscales. We considered assessing the perceived Value / Usefulness (5 items) to be of key importance for gamification in science, as well as Interest / Enjoyment (4 items). Enjoyment has also been used to characterize user preferences of game design elements by Tondello et al. [41]. The interest / enjoyment subscale assesses intrinsic motivation per se, while task meaningfulness appeals to the innate need for autonomy [38]. \u2022 We further asked to rate a statement that targets the suitability of the design: The system is NOT suitable for a research preservation service.

Documenting and sharing research data and resources are key requirements of reproducible research [3,43]. But, the efforts required to prepare, document and share experimental data [9] are often not matched by the perceived gain. In fact, studies claim that the scientific culture does not support or even impairs compliance with reproducible practices [4,17]. Considering missing incentive structures, common proposals target the implementation of policies; most prominently concerning funding rules [36] and requirements for conference and journal submissions [5,39].", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_para_7": "To stimulate feedback, we created two designs that are based on our researcher-and service-centered insights. Following our initial expectation that gamification in a professional scientific context is most likely to profit from a serious, informative and rule-based design language, we created the Rational-Informative Design (RID) that provides information expected to appeal to HEP researchers. The RID was designed to make less use of most common game elements like points and leaderboards. Instead, it uses elements of \"Social networks\", \"Social discovery\", \"Signposting\" and \"Challenges\" (the LHC collaboration goal on the dashboard) as suggested by Tondello et al. [41]. This enables an exploration of gameful design elements in the HEP context. Yet, as scientists are already subjected to a high degree of competition, we also created a contrasting Simple Game Elements Design (SGED) version that focuses on point-based rewards and competitive elements. The basic UI design rules (color scheme, arrangements, etc.) are the same for both versions and are inspired by the actual service design.

Thus, where engagement with a serious game or gamified application is mandated, and/or the game or application reinforce existing restrictions of conduct, this will likely reduce people's autonomy. Several scholars and practitioners have suggested that 'good' gamification should be voluntary to participate in; only involve activities that are voluntary to begin with, or in the case of workplace gamification, not involve core job tasks necessarily linked to remuneration and promotion; and rather than reinforce existing regulations, it should restructure activity such that participants have a greater ability to align what they do when, how, and with whom with their own interests and needs, analogous to e.g. Montessori pedagogy or results-only work environments [31,58,61,[65][66][67][68].

Basic need satisfaction explains why activities like play are intrinsically motivating, while autonomy provides a well-established construct for \"voluntariness\". SDT-informed research has identified contextual features that affect autonomy and demonstrated that need satisfaction can explain game play motivation.

While such eforts are no doubt essential, there are several strands of work in HCI that explore the benefts of engaging with uncertainty. Research in the area of ambiguous design, for example, has argued that purposeful inclusion of ambiguity can support deeper appropriation of complex technologies by users [42]. Game design rests on careful use of uncertainty to create tension, challenge, and engagement from participants [25].

In their work, Hamari et al. [26] conducted a literature review of empirical studies on gamification. They report on 10 investigated motivational affordance categories, including levels, stories, clear goals, feedback, rewards, progress and challenges, noting that \"points, leaderboards, and badges were clearly the most commonly found variants. \" As becomes increasingly evident, gamification that adds leaderboards, points and badges only to drive business goals, is likely to prevent long-lasting engagement and even risks alienating users [32]. Instead, gamification profits from a holistic design process that appeals to the intrinsic motivation of the players [11,19], requiring systematic, user-centered designs [29,42]. This motivated our researcher-centered gamification design process. Intrinsic motivation results from activities that are perceived as satisfactorily or pleasurably in themselves. Self-determination theory (SDT), as described by Ryan and Deci [37], distinguishes intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is based on external goals that represent outcomes separable from the activity itself (e.g. rewards, money or social approval) and intrinsic motivation comes from psychological needs: Competence, Autonomy and Relatedness.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_2": "This study contributes to HCI by advancing our understanding and explicating some nuances of self-initiated individual smartphone use in co-present interactions. We show that the type of smartphone-based activity and the interactional context afect the way in which a particular instance of smartphone use is designed and oriented to by other participants. Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75]. By analyzing naturally occurring interactions, this study seeks to identify issues with existing defnitions of phubbing and ofers a new conceptualization for future research. As this study also investigates participants' practices of returning smartphone users back into conversations, we conclude the paper with design implications, aiming to support participants' practices for dealing with extended smartphone use.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_metadata": "Authors: Iuliia Avgustis | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2023 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference"}}

Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]). However, this individualistic perspective overlooks how students, teachers and therapists are afected by the organisations within which they operate, and which in turn are impacted on a societal level, thereby risking to undermine ongoing processes of empowerment.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_metadata": "Authors: Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Zhihao Fan, Zengfeng Huang, Weijian Sun, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_metadata": "Authors: Maitraye Das, Brent J.

In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, it is seen as a means of empowering people, providing affordable and customisable technology with potential to enrich areas such as education or assistive technology. To investigate this alleged potential, we performed an anthropological inquiry at an elementary school for disabled children that lasted one year, participating in everyday activities with students, teachers, and therapists. We observed \u2018heterogeneity in a fluid environment\u2019 and \u2018creativity in the moment\u2019 in an \u2018endemically underfunded\u2019 setting. We saw how technology is \u2018injecting dependencies\u2019, \u2018reinforcing disability\u2019, and \u2018occupying time and space\u2019, changing our view on the role that making can have.

However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

For well-studied conventional feature-based models in NLP, there are various classic transfer approaches, such as EasyAdapt (Daum\u00e9, 2007), instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and structural correspondence learning (Blitzer et al., 2006). Fewer works have been focused on transfer approaches for neural models in NLP. Mou et al. (2016) use intuitive transfer methods (INIT and MULT) to study the transferability of neural network models for the sentence (pair) classification problem; Lee et al. (2017) utilize the INIT method on highly related datasets of electronic health records to study their specific deidentification problem. Yang et al. (2017b) use the MULT approach in sequence tagging tasks including named entity recognition. Following the MULT scheme, Wang et al. (2018) introduce a label-aware mechanism into maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to explicitly reduce domain shift between the same labels across domains in medical data. Their approach requires the output space to be the same in both source and target domains.

Generally it requires labeled data from the source and only unlabeled data from the target to learn such representations. While these representations act like a bridge to transfer knowledge learned in the source to the target; they may lead to negative transfer when the source specific characteristics detract their ability to represent the target data. We present a novel neural network architecture to simultaneously learn a two-part representation which is based on the principle of segregating source specific representation from the common representation. The first part captures the source specific characteristics while the second part captures the truly common representation. Our architecture optimizes an objective function which acts adversarial for the source specific part if it contributes towards the cross-domain learning. We empirically show that two parts of the representation, in different arrangements, outperforms existing learning algorithms on the source learning as well as cross-domain tasks on multiple datasets.", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_metadata": "Authors: Arjun Reddy Akula, Spandana Gella, Keze Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Siva Reddy | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_metadata": "Authors: Mingyang Zhou, Josh Arnold, Zhou Yu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_metadata": "Authors: Jing Ma, Wei Gao, Shafiq R.

(5) Other text classification: multiple social-media datasets on classifying tweets into (a) 2-way: political audience, bias or mention of a disaster, (b) 9-way: classifying based on political message, (c) 13-way: classifying emotion.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_abstract": "We introduce a general method for the interpretation and comparison of neural models. The method is used to factor a complex neural model into its functional components, which are comprised of sets of co-firing neurons that cut across layers of the network architecture, and which we call neural pathways. The function of these pathways can be understood by identifying correlated task level and linguistic heuristics in such a way that this knowledge acts as a lens for approximating what the network has learned to apply to its intended task. As a case study for investigating the utility of these pathways, we present an examination of pathways identified in models trained for two standard tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Recognizing Textual Entailment."}}

These algorithms come in two flavors. First, random walks through Markov chains have been used to sample spanning trees from both undirected (Broder, 1989;Aldous, 1990) and directed graphs (Wilson, 1996). The algorithm of Wilson (1996) is linear in the mean hitting time of the graph and is currently the fastest sampling algorithm for directed spanning trees. It has been used in dependency parsing inference by Zhang et al. (2014a,b). Second, several algorithms have leveraged the matrix-tree theorem (MTT; Kirchhoff, 1847;Tutte, 1984). The MTT has been frequently used to perform inference on non-projective graphbased dependency parsers (Koo et al., 2007;Mc-Donald and Satta, 2007;Smith and Smith, 2007;Zmigrod et al., 2021). This theorem was first used for sampling by Gu\u00e9noche (1983) who gave an O(N 5 ) algorithm which was then improved by Kulkarni (1990) and Colbourn et al. (1996). Colbourn et al. (1996) give an O(N 3 ) algorithm to sample spanning trees from an unweighted directed graph.

We address a new application of attention, and introduce a significantly different attention mechanism, which allows each variable to focus on multiple objects. We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

When each concept fragment is processed, edges are added between the current concept fragment and its predecessors. However, how to treat its predecessors is a difficult problem. In our experiments, we found that if we consider every preceding concept fragment to the left of the current fragment in a right-to-left order in the search process, the decoder suffers from low efficiency and poor performance. Unlike the beam-search for dependency parsing, which can greatly reduce the search space by exploiting the projectivity property of the dependency tree (Covington, 2001;Zhang and Clark, 2008a), this naive search process in this context inevitably leads to huge search space, and furthermore is difficult to guarantee the connectivity of output graph. Instead, we propose a componentwise beam search scheme, which can not only alleviate much noisy partial candidate, but also ensure that the final output graph is connected.", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_para_5": "In this section, we present an extension to the ancestral sampling algorithm of Colbourn et al.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_1": "Regarding the overall satisfaction with the platform, 25 subjects participated in a post-experiment online survey.

We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled. With respect to the two potential mediators meditation experience and daily self-reported motivation, we found that meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies (M = 1.

However, from 2020 he has started selling his cows online since his younger brother says that the digital marketplace is the future of this business. Shohel sends the photos and essential information (breed, weight, age, etc.) of his cattle heads via Viber to his brother. His brother posts those photos and information on several online haat Facebook pages. Due to his limited digital literacy, Shohel entirely depended on his younger brother for selling cows online. Without even having a \"true\" conversation with a customer, Shohel sold his cows online during Eid of 2020. He was sitting at his \"dawa\" (veranda of a rural house) when middlemen from Dhaka came and picked his cows up from his small farm. Shohel is concerned about this type of online shopping, where no one acknowledges his contribution to this holy festival, and he becomes invisible. He says, \"I was interviewed by Somoy TV channel reporter in 2017, when I was in Dhaka, selling my cows at Gabtoli cattle market.

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017)."}}

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_metadata": "Authors: Jun Gong, Aakar Gupta, Hrvoje Benko | Venue: ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_abstract": "Joint improvised activity and synchrony of movement increases affiliation between people.

Related work to this paper mainly includes: Classification on Imbalanced Data. Conventional approaches addressed data imbalance from either data-level or algorithm-level. Data-level approaches resample the training data to maintain the balance between different classes (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002;Drummond et al., 2003). Further improvements on this direction involve how to better sampling data with minimum in-formation loss (Carvajal et al., 2004;Estabrooks et al., 2004;Han et al., 2005;Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro et al., 2011). Algorithm-level approaches attempt to choose an appropriate inductive bias on models or algorithms to make them more suitable on data imbalance condition, including instance weighting (Ting, 2002;Lin et al., 2017), cost-sensitive learning (Anand et al., 1993;Domingos, 1999;Sun et al., 2007;Krawczyk et al., 2014) and active learning approaches (Ertekin et al., 2007a,b;Zhu and Hovy, 2007). F-Measure Optimization. Previous research on F-measure optimization mainly fell into two paradigms (Nan et al., 2012): 1) Decisiontheoretic approaches (DTA), which first estimate a probability model and find the optimal predictions according to that model (Joachims, 2005;Jansche, 2005Jansche, , 2007Dembczynski et al., 2011;Busa-Fekete et al., 2015;Natarajan et al., 2016). The main drawback of these methods is that they need to estimate the joint probability with exponentially many combinations, thus make them hard to use in practice; 2) Empirical utility maximization (EUM) approaches, which adapt approximate methods to find a best classifier in hypothesises (Musicant et al., 2003;Chinta et al., 2013;Parambath et al., 2014;Narasimhan et al., 2014). However, EUM methods depend on thresholds or costs that are not known a priori so time-consuming searching on large development set is required. Our adaptive scaling algorithm is partially inspired by EUM approaches, but is based on the marginal utility framework, which doesn't introduce any additional hyper-parameter or searching procedure. Neural Network based Event Detection. Event detection is a typical task of detection problems. Recently neural network based methods have achieved significant progress in Event Detection. CNNs (Chen et al., 2015;Nguyen and Grishman, 2015) and Bi-LSTMs (Zeng et al., 2016;Yang and Mitchell, 2017) are two effective and widely used models. Some improvements have been made by jointly predicting triggers and arguments  or introducing more complicated architectures to capture larger scale of contexts Ghaeini et al., 2016).", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_5": "To evaluate our interpretation technique on real world data, we applied our method on four trained models over two tasks: recognizing textual entailment using the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference corpus (Williams et al., 2018) and named entity recognition using the CoNLL 2003 data (Sang and Meulder, 2003) for English NER.

dependency knowledge. The basic idea is to map dependency arcs from a source treebank to its target translation according to word alignments. This method, however, can suffer from imperfect alignment between source and target words. To address this problem, we investigate syntactic transfer by code mixing, translating only confident words in a source treebank. Cross-lingual word embeddings are leveraged for transferring syntactic knowledge to the target from the resulting code-mixed treebank. Experiments on University Dependency Treebanks show that code-mixed treebanks are more effective than translated treebanks, giving highly competitive performances among cross-lingual parsing methods.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_metadata": "Authors: Min-Hsuan Yeh, Lun-Wei Ku | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

Coding activities are considered to promote analytical thinking, abstraction abilities, [7,40,47,48], and computational literacy [20]. As coding becomes common in many schools, a wide range of approaches should be developed for introducing coding to diverse audiences.

The essence of outdoor play is \"heads up\" social interaction and physical activity [11,16,31,43], which are not natural characteristics of coding activities. Moreover, adding screens to outdoor play (a coding platform running on a tablet device) is thought to interfere with natural play patterns [34] and compromise the benefits of natural play [44]. Nonetheless, the children successfully bridged this gap, using the \"heads down\" coding activity to create code that generates a \"heads up\" outdoor game experience. In addition, children played their games with their friends with no further adjustments to the code, indicating that they were able to program playable outdoor games. This may be attributed to the clear distinction between the coding platform and the digital device, that framed the coding platform as a tool for defining the game and the device as a tool for playing the game. Future work should test this assumption and compare the digital coding platform to a more tangible coding platform. While physical programming may preserve the \"heads up\" nature of outdoor play, it may also be perceived as part of the game instead of a mechanism for defining the game rules.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_para_3": "However, the integration of coding and outdoor play is not trivial.

Coding, a typically indoor, screen-based activity, can potentially enrich outdoor play, serving as a rule-making medium. We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device, enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas, coding them, and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study, 24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones, enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements, integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code, and were excited to see their code come to life. We conclude children can use coding to express their ideas by creating technologically-enhanced outdoor play experiences.", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_metadata": "Authors: Nikhila Nyapathy, R.

However, people frequently lack valuable knowledge about at least one application, especially as software changes and new software emerges. Existing help systems either lack contextual knowledge or are tightly-knit into a single application. We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources and demonstrate it through the RePlay system. RePlay uses accessibility APIs to gather context about the user's activity. It leverages an existing search engine to present relevant videos and highlights key segments within them using video captions. We report on a week-long field study (n=7) and a lab study (n=24) showing that contextual assistance helps people spend less time away from their task than web video search and replaces current video navigation strategies. Our findings highlight challenges with representing and using context across applications.", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_metadata": "Authors: Kagonya Awori, M.

We embody this approach in the RePlay system, which enables users to search for learning videos based on their application usage. RePlay gathers application context using system accessibility apis. It extends online video search and cues videos to relevant segments based on their captions. We focus on video assistance because despite video's growing popularity (Cisco predicts that by 2021, 82% of all internet traffic will be video [2]), searching and browsing video remain cumbersome [25,39,40]. Video is popular for content creators as it is often easier to author than tutorials or diagrams (which require careful curation). Learners value video for its efficacy in communicating complex or continuous visual actions such as brushing or setting parameters [10].

Several techniques automatically extract instructional video clips from screencasts of software use. The dominant approach leverages application usage [10,20,29,52], requiring that the video be recorded in an instrumented version of the software. Alternatively, computer vision can detect tool-selection events [32,41], even without prior knowledge about the specific software [5]. To be application-independent and embed online videos directly without waiting to download and process them, RePlay instead uses metadata and caption text to rank and segment videos.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_10": "RePlay's main insight is that given a source of user context, we can search, curate, and index into resources from a large corpus. RePlay demonstrates this approach using video; different activities (e.g., programming) may benefit from other types of content (e.g., text resources). RePlay could naturally be extended to any textual content (or content with textual metadata). Text results could be displayed as short summaries with clickable keywords to expand more detail [13]. For detecting context, RePlay used MacOS's accessibility api; other oss (e.g. Windows [34]) also have similar apis. Beyond software, RePlay's approach could extend to any domain for which online videos are abundant (e.g., physical building tasks). To detect activity context, one could augment physical tools with sensors [31,46] or track body poses with wearable sensors or computer vision. A challenge for future work is to convert sensor or vision data into text searches, or to index videos using the sensor or vision data directly.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_metadata": "Authors: Wenjian Huang, T.

However, we are not aware of literature describing how this should be done in a numeric and comparable way. The research on measuring usability concentrates on usability testing [24]. To our knowledge, HED is the first such method reported for IT procurement that also addresses the criticized shortcomings [9,38] of traditional heuristic evaluation.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_metadata": "Authors: Justin Matejka, Michael Glueck, Tovi Grossman, G.

The current practice on measuring usability indeed heavily relies on usability tests while inspection methods are not discussed [24]. Attempts to quantify HE have been presented [20] for evaluating the degree of usability of websites.

Word-level F1, commonly used in the Machine Comprehension and ConvQA tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018Choi et al., 2018), evaluates the word overlap between the system's prediction and the ground truth answer span. Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1. Given n references (ground-truth answers) for each question, human F1 is calculated by averaging the maximum F1 from each n\u22121 subset with respect to the heldout reference (Choi et al., 2018).

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_metadata": "Authors: Hyunchul Lim, Jungmin Chung, Changhoon Oh, Sohyun Park, Joonhwan Lee, B.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_metadata": "Authors: Mingyang Zhou, Josh Arnold, Zhou Yu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_metadata": "Authors: Mitchell Stern, Jacob Andreas, D.

The current study leverages natural emergence of the sense of ownership and sense of agency in the virtual environments, i.e., feelings that the users own their virtual body or body parts and that they are the agents of actions of such virtual body. Using state-of-the-art VR (with a head-mounted display and accurate hand tracking), two VR scenes where participants experienced the illusory touch were created. In the active scene, participants actively touched a virtual object (ball) using their bare hands. On the contrary, the passive scene allowed participants to experience the illusory touch without actively moving their hands.", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_metadata": "Authors: Minha Lee, Renee Noortman, Cristina Zaga, A.

This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

In the case of the word embedding models, we create document vectors in the same way as we do for our model, by simply replacing the role of target word vectors with document word vectors. In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations. We tuned the dimensionality of the embedding from the pool {100, 150, 200} and the number of vMF mixture components from the pool {200, 500, 800}.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_6": "In this section, we describe the word embedding results, where we directly compare our model with the following baselines: GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), Skipgram (Mikolov et al., 2013b) (denoted as SG), Continuous Bag of Words (Mikolov et al., 2013b) (denoted as CBOW), and the recently proposed WeMAP model (Jameel et al., 2019).

These vectors are normally learned such that they are predictive of some word co-occurrence statistic, but they are otherwise unconstrained. However, the words from a given language can be organized in various natural groupings, such as syntactic word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs) and semantic themes (e.g. sports, politics, sentiment). Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors. We show that this results in word vectors which are qualitatively different from those obtained with existing word embedding models. We furthermore show that our embedding model can also be used to learn high-quality document representations.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_3": "In recent years, several approaches that combine the intuitions underlying topic models with word embeddings have been proposed. For example, in (Das et al., 2015) it was proposed to replace the usual representation of topics as multinomial distributions over words by Gaussian distributions over a pre-trained word embedding, while (Batmanghelich et al., 2016) and (Li et al., 2016b) used von Mises-Fisher distributions for this purpose. Note that documents are still modelled as multinomial distributions of topics in these models. In (He et al., 2017) the opposite approach is taken: documents and topics are represented as vectors, with the aim of modelling topic correlations in an efficient way, while each topic is represented as a multinomial distribution over words. In this paper, we take a different approach for learning document vectors, by not considering any documentspecific topic distribution. This allows us to represent document vectors and (context) word vectors in the same space and, as we will see, leads to improved empirical results.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

For instance, we might perhaps expect that words from the same part-of-speech class should be clustered together in the word embedding. Similarly, we might expect that organising word vectors in clusters that represent semantic themes would also be beneficial. In fact, a number of approaches have already been proposed that use external knowledge for imposing such a cluster structure, capturing the intuition that words which belong to the same category should be represented by similar vectors (Xu et al., 2014;Guo et al., 2015;Hu et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016c) or be located in a low-dimensional subspace (Jameel and Schockaert, 2016).

Compare to LASER (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019b), our models perform significantly better on low-resource languages, boosting the overall accuracy on 112 languages to 83.7%, from the 65.5% achieved by the previous state-of-art. Surprisingly, we observe our models performs well on 30+ Tatoeba languages for which we have no explicit monolingual or bilingual training data. Finally, our embeddings perform competitively on the SentEval sentence embedding transfer learning benchmark (Conneau and Kiela, 2018)."}}

We show that the type of smartphone-based activity and the interactional context afect the way in which a particular instance of smartphone use is designed and oriented to by other participants. Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75].

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis. We adopt a sensor fusion approach by taking both 'surface waves' (i.e., vibrations through surface) and 'sound waves' (i.e., vibrations through air) into analysis to improve sensing resolution. We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_9": "The TDOA approach. For localizing the acoustic signal, the most prevalent approach, which we also use in this work, is time difference of arrival (TDOA) analysis [10,24,36,37,48,49]. For example, PingPongPlus [24] instruments four contact microphones located at the outermost corners of the desired interactive region. When a Ping-Pong ball falls inside of this region, the signal arrives to the four sensors at different times, enabling a hyperbolic intersection localization. Likewise, SurfaceVibe [36] also uses four geophones in a similar setup to enable two interaction types, tap and swipe, on multiple types of surfaces. Instead of instrumenting the surfaces, Toffee [48] augments the mobile devices and laptops with four piezo sensors and demonstrates accurate resolution of the bearings of touch events around the devices, although the evaluation considers only a single user. Besides TDOA analysis, SoundCraft [17] instead uses a target signal subspace method, by adopting the basic idea of Multiple Signal Classification technique, which can localize acoustic signals even in noisy environment.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_0": "We assume the distance between Sensor A and B to be 4 cm (a common wrist length), the distance between Sensor A and Tap D to be 18cm (a common hand size), the distance between the two taps (C and D, E and F) to be 4cm, and the speed of sound to be 340m/s. Populating the equations with these numbers, we get the differences of two TDOAs along X axis and Y axis as 25.8\u00b5s and 3.6\u00b5s respectively. This is why X axis localization is easier than Y axis. A similar conclusion can also be found in Toffee [48] and SoundCraft [17] since both solutions only work in angular estimation (similar to X-axis) instead of distance interpolation (similar to Y-axis).", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_8": "Many passive acoustic approaches have been employed to detect gestures [12,20,21,52] and localize signals [17,24,36,37,48,49].

This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \"idle\" fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_8": "To track the motion of secondary fingers in the air, the ring-like device prototypes were worn on the thumb and the index finger. We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_5": "Choice of consumer-grade recording hardware.

The model divides the cognitive process in synchronisation tasks into two parts: an internal time-keeping process is followed by a motor response with time delay. Both time-keeping precision and motor delay are assumed to be stochastic and separately represented by additive random noise with a mean and variance. Noise components can be extracted from a tapping experiment by examining autocorrelation in consecutive asynchronies [39]. The variance of the time-keeping process linearly increases with IOI [27,29], There is a similarity here to the model of ballistic movements in the spatial domain, in which the SD of end location linearly increases with target amplitude D s .

In other words, the user is asked to move as quickly as possible to hit the target. Fitts introduced the concept of index of difficulty: M T = a + bID s = a+b log 2 (2D s /W s ). Wobbrock et al. [40] analysed Fitts' law to derive a model of error rates with three task requirements mixed in the temporal and spatial domain: target size D s , target width W s , and temporal target distance D t . As this paper does, they predicted error rates, because there was an explicit requirement to maintain a temporal distance to the target D t . Besides, when the spatial requirement W s is relaxed from Fitts' task, targeting becomes more open-loop-like. Gan and Hoffman [9] proposed a model to predict M T when the goal is to hit a large target at distance D s . Hoffman's law originally predicted M T = a + b \u221a D s . With additional assumptions, it can be expressed as the constant ratio between D s and the standard deviation (SD) of end points [12].", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_metadata": "Authors: Manika Saha, Delvin Varghese, Tom Bartindale, S.

On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled.

Using TangibleRubik, a user's password consists of a series of moves with the tube, such as turning parts of it. These moves are captured by a webcam. A preliminary user study of TangibleRubik revealed that duration of password entry (34 and 52 seconds) were perceived as too long.

The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31]. Users tend to rely more on anticipation (their internal clock) than on reaction when the task becomes more difficult.

[11] classifed hurricane risk images shared by authorities on social media throughout the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season and described their prevalence, difusion, and reception by the public. Their study supports prior risk communication research that suggests that emphasizing, rather than obscuring, uncertainty or alternative outcomes in visualizations may support better decision-making by viewers [45] [48].", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_18": "Over the past fve decades tropical cyclones have, on average, killed 10,000 people and caused $15 billion dollars in damage a year [37]. These impacts are only predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change and continued population growth and urban development in storm prone areas [55] [67]. Improving the ways in which science can help at-risk communities understand, prepare for, and mitigate the impacts of major storm events is thus a critical task, and one to which HCI can make important contributions. In this paper we provide an overview of an initial research agenda for HCI that focuses on communicating risk information to the public during the predictive phase of storms. As HCI research in this space continues to develop, we anticipate that further opportunities will develop and that we may also take on related questions, such as risk communications focused primarily in urban and regional planning decisions aimed at mitigating storm risk, rather than taking protective action in the lead-up period. Inasmuch as we argue that HCI can support this agenda, we also believe that our feld would be enriched through focus on these issues. Questions of representation of uncertainty, trust in information, and the human relationship to the environment are critical areas of work across HCI that research into tropical storm risk communication may inform.", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

These fndings may be built upon further through augmented or virtual reality techniques that have been experimented with in science education and visualizations about climate change and disaster [10]. The Weather Channel has also used these tools to communicate disaster risk to the public [56]. AR/VR tools have also been used by HCI research into science education [106]. Such approaches ofer the potential to deliver contextualized risk information to the public in ways that includes familiar local landmarks and settings, which is thought to improve user understanding and trust. Finally, including information about vulnerable communities or public resources is another tactic that may be useful. Communication of vulnerability ahead of storm arrival could provide additional information to users about potential impacts of the storm in ways that support decision-making or improved understanding of hurricane risk.", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_metadata": "Authors: Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Roberto Navigli | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties. Thus, there is much opportunity for HCI and information visualization research to continue studying efective methods for uncertainty visualization approaches for hurricane forecasts [20] [105] [109] [113] [133].", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

For example, research has shown that graphics are more efective at communicating risk than text products, yet members of the public often have trouble interpreting commonly used graphics used to describe hurricane projections [26] [96] [105]. In addition, ofcial information created and disseminated by hurricane experts at NOAA or local emergency management ofces is increasingly competing for the public's attention with other sources of information including mainstream and social media and information received from neighbors, friends, and family-members. Another challenge is that many contextual factors, including prior experience with storms, socioeconomic status, and behaviors of an individual's social networks, infuence people's decisions to prepare, evacuate, or take other protective actions prior to storms [15] [32]. Prior work in HCI has highlighted the importance of further in vivo studies through contextual inquiry or other methods in order to address the wide variety of contexts in which the public accesses and interprets risk information [11].", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_metadata": "Authors: Fangxiaoyu Feng, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Matthew Cer, N.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_metadata": "Authors: Roy Schwartz, Sam Thomson, Noah A.

Conversational Question Answering: This is a conversational search task, where the system needs to correctly interpret a question in the context of an ongoing conversation. Most research on conversational QA focuses on conversational response ranking tasks (Dalton et al., 2019(Dalton et al., , 2020(Dalton et al., , 2021 and extractive QA tasks (Choi et al., 2018;Reddy et al., 2019;Qu et al., 2019b;Yeh and Chen, 2019). Qu et al. (2020) were first to define the task of Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (OR-ConvQA), where the system is required to learn to retrieve top relevant passages from a large collection before extracting answers from the passages. To address the ORConvQA task, Qu et al. (2020) proposed a three-stage pipeline: (1) a retriever, (2) a reranker, and (3) a reader. Later, Qu et al. (2021) introduced a learned weakly-supervised training approach to address the problem of accessing gold passages during the training of the model on the OR-CoQA dataset in (Qu et al., 2020). One particular problem is coarse ranking, where the reranker of Qu et al. (2020) only takes the top-ranked passages as input. This makes the whole pipeline suffers from this coarse ranking, especially for situations when the golden passages are not retrieved in the top-ranked passages. Liang et al. (2022) addressed this issue by adding a post-ranker module that can push more relevant passages to the reader. However, these works typically approach reranking and reading as classification tasks to find an answer span for retrieved passages (start/end positions). Instead, we use a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader in order to directly extract the answers for the users instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_abstract": "To address the Conversational Question Answering (ORConvQA) task, previous work has considered an effective three-stage architecture, consisting of a retriever, a reranker, and a reader to extract the answers.

However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020).

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question.

To adopt an MTL approach to a text generation model for jointly learning from both passage reranking and answer extraction, the MTL model makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task and the follow-up tokens for the answer extraction task. In particular, when fine-tuning the T5 model for a downstream task, we use Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify the model by using a taskspecific prompt together with the input . We deploy a T5 model to capture the relation between the rewritten question q r of the current question q c and the passage p as shown in the right part of Figure 3.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_12": "Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has increasingly become a popular approach for tackling several tasks in a uniform model .

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

implies that citizens can legitimize cyberattacks instead of condemning them. We propose to adopt an argumentative approach to identify which premises allow such legitimization. To showcase this approach, we created four short narratives describing cyberattacks involving generic users and covering different motives for the attacks: profit, recreation, revenge, and ideology. A sample of 16 participants read the four narratives and was afterward interviewed to express their position on the attacks described. All interview transcripts were then analyzed with an argumentative approach, and 15 premises were found to account for the different positions taken. We describe the premises, their distribution across the four narratives, and discuss the implications of this approach for cybersecurity.", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_metadata": "Authors: Bin Liang, Qinglin Zhu, Xiang Li, Min Yang, Lin Gui, Yulan He, Ruifeng Xu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

Curiosity is the pursuit of the excitement connected to intellectual challenges. Proft refers to actions driven by greed or personal fnancial gain\" ( [45], p.100). Notoriety, also called prestige, consists of pursuing \"media attention, bragging, and the quest for fame\" ( [45], p. 100). Revenge is the search for compensating a tort sufered by the attacker. We excluded notoriety and curiosity from this original set of four motives because they did not ft our purposes: we were interested in cases involving lay people in the attack and not in a single attacker wanting to gain popularity or test their talent. We then added recreation or fun [17] and ideology, which refers to ideological and societal motives [50].

Colnago et al. [14] documented the attitudes and behaviors surrounding twofactor authentication (2FA) as it was rolled out at a large research university. Regarding account sharing, the authors found that 2FA interfered with the ability of some students to share their financial accounts with parents, because the parents could only use the shared password at a time when the students were available to answer the 2FA push notification. They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities. They found that about half did not make their security policies publicly accessible, and that these policies were seldom consistent or shared source materials; moreover, the policies tended to be difficult to read, lacking in emotional language, and worded ambiguously and/or tentatively, such that the takeaways were unclear.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_1": "We propose that legitimization of cyberattacks is made possible by the argumentative nature of position-taking. Assigning someone the status of the victim or the ofender is the result of an interpretive, interactional process [23] [56]. identifying the premises on which favorable argumentation rests would help to understand how lay citizens could legitimize (or condemn) cyberattacks. (We prefer to use the term legitimized over neutralized or justifed/excused because the former term assumes a cognitive model that is not necessary to our purpose; the terms justifed or excused only refer to a subset of neutralization techniques, and are then not adequate to refer to all techniques in general [49].) To showcase this argumentative approach to legitimization, we study the position on cyberattacks of a small sample of university students, who represent a typical participant in the literature on cybercrime [5]. The investigation uses a refexive thematic analysis [6] [7], which is open to the arguments spontaneously used by the participants. The purpose is not to map the entire argumentative space used by university students to make sense of cyberattacks, but to illustrate an argumentative approach and draw some cybersecurity implications from the results. We will start by briefy explaining what we mean by \"argumentative\".", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_metadata": "Authors: James Fiacco, Samridhi Choudhary, C.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads.

The system uses a visual perceptual mechanism for smooth motion parallax in the horizontal direction with fewer projectors than previous works. A 360-degree camera mounted above the table and image recognition software detects users' positions around the table and the heights of their faces (eyes) as they move around the table in real-time. Those mechanics help display correct vertical and horizontal direction motion parallax for different users simultaneously. Our system also has a user interaction function with a tablet device that manipulates 3D objects displayed on the table. These functions support collaborative work and communication between users.

Researchers have been working on presenting various methods of projecting viewpoint images from multiple projectors onto a screen with narrow diffusion characteristics [33,19,18,22]. In such a multi-view 3D display, the number of viewpoints is increased to smooth changes between viewpoints, present the binocular parallax, and widen the visual field area. A uniform viewpoint distribution is necessary for extending the viewing zone over 360-degree  horizontal directions around the table. Conventional methods  of expanding the viewing area to 360 degrees around the table   are roughly divided into a time division method, like a rotation mechanism, and a space division method with multiple  displays or projectors. Jones et al. [17] proposed a time division method that presents 360-degree 3D images with a high-speed video projector and a rotating mirror covered with a holographic diffuser. Inoue et al. [14] proposed a rotating screen system that uses a microelectro-mechanical systems spatial light modulator (MEMS SLM). Takaki et al. [45] proposed a configuration that has three projectors and a rotating screen. The systems of Inoue and Takaki both use a screen that is constructed with a Fresnel lens whose optical axis is shifted to focus light at the users' positions. With a configuration that uses a rotating mirror or a screen, the users' hands cannot be brought close to the 3D objects for their own safety. Butler et al. [4] proposed a 360-degree 3D display in which hands can be brought close to a 3D object because there is a rotating screen and a highspeed digital micromirror device (DMD) projector under the two parabolic mirrors placed opposite each other, and the 3D image is imaged in the air. Lim et al. [27] proposed a similar system that uses four synchronized high-speed DMDs.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

We investigate whether findings in oral code-switching concerning content and style, as well as speaker proficiency, are carried over into written code-switching in discussion forums.

Two coders labelled 4,500 unique comments with at least one of the thirteen types of essential components extracted from our theoretical analysis (see label development documentation in Section 3.4 and Appendix B). To ensure intercoder reliability and the representativeness of the sample, we performed the following procedures. First, coders discussed the developed minimal theoretic conceptualization, reviewed predefined examples for each class, and resolved any questions about the nature of the classes. Then, both coders labelled the same set of 100 random comments from the corpus, yielding a Krippendorf alpha of 0.7. After discussing prevailing differences in the coding tactics, coders learned to adjust their coding in a way that conformed more to the theoretic framework. Coders then relabelled the same corpus, yielding an intercoder reliability of 0.75. This was higher than the expected minimum for coding complicated language tasks in the literature (>0.6 -see e.g., [5,37,43,92,105,122]). Since coders' labeling practices were robust, they proceeded with the selection and labeling of further comments. Specifically, an initial sample of 1650 comments was labeled, containing 30 comments from each subreddit in the dataset. Next, a second batch of 1000 comments was annotated, which we randomly selected by stratified sampling among subreddits. To assess how many comments were necessary for an accurate classifier, we trained a preliminary language model on these 2750 comments, finding that for reliable prediction for each class, at least 300 observations were necessary. To satisfy this condition, we continued labeling comments by stratified random sampling until an annotated sample of 4500 comments was produced.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_para_1": "Many studies have elucidated the communicative functions of oral code-switching.

Other studies have focused more on the characteristics of code-switchers themselves: While CS has mostly been viewed as a deliberate choice of a proficient bilingual speaker, requiring adept control of two simultaneously-activated linguistic systems (Costa and Santesteban, 2004;Kootstra et al., 2012), mixing two languages may also serve as a strategy for bridging lexical inefficacy in a second language (Grosjean, 1982;Faerch and Kasper, 1983;Poulisse, 1989).", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

We therefore first conducted a Content Analysis [16,35], inductively coding each submission to capture initial patterns related to (i) the types of topics, issues and tasks users requested or created bots for, and (ii) the types of functionalities and technical features that underpinned requested and created bots. Second, we were interested in the discussions surrounding bots on the Reddit platform. As such, we conducted a Thematic Analysis of all submission and comment data. Following [9], we coded individual submissions and comments, when necessary at the sentence to paragraph level, to summarise content for semantic and latent meaning. Once all data was coded, we compared and contrasted codes, grouped related codes together, and used these as the starting point for creating themes. Finally, we selected exemplar data as evidence of talk underpinning themes to be presented as part of our findings. The coding process across both stages was conducted by three researchers, who regularly met to share codes, discuss different interpretations of data, and to refine codes and subsequent themes.", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_20": "To further control for other factors that could plausibly affect the outcome, we again used the Wayback Machine [8] to extract different moderation rules that existed in each subreddit during the investigated period. Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116].

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

There is potential here, however, for exploring the ways in which online environments might be designed or reconfigured to support the expression of ideas around software agents. Inspiration might be found here in literature that has examined the ways in which other online platforms support exchanges of knowledge and advice between expert and novice coders [26]. For example, Asaduzzaman et al [5] have examined why requests for help get left unresolved on platforms like StackOverflow\u00d1they highlight that those questions that are \u00d4too short, unclear, vague or hard to follow\u00d5, too specific or perceived to involve too much work often get ignored. Contrastingly, Nashei et al [38] highlight that good questions on the same platform tend to encourage continued discussion where the initial problem gets redefined. Similarly, those responses that work best tend to be those that are concise, refer back to the question asked, highlight key elements, and provide step-by-step instructions and explore multiple solutions. Furthermore, studies of expert online communities of programmers have highlighted the importance of timely responses, both from those asking a question and those proposing answers [40].", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_7": "Finally, the quantitative findings of this paper do appear to correspond with theories on the development of distinct interests among organization leaders [69].

Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_5": "As a study that sets out to describe and explain rather than create, this work of action research brings together virtual ethnography [11] with the emerging practice of \"popular data,\" where researchers and participants create questions and interpretations together [10,19].

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim.

Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_3": "Our experiments adopt the popular three-stage pipeline of FEVER task, comprising document selection, evidence sentence extraction, and claim verification (Thorne et al., 2018b).

Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI).

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_0": "We adopted the widely used document selection method from Hanselowski et al.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

However, the factuality of a claim is independent of people's belief and subjective language use, and human perception is unconsciously prone to misinformation due to the common cognitive biases such as naive realism (Reed et al., 2013) and confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998).", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_metadata": "Authors: S.

(vi) Whether the input event mentions have a common derivational form derived from WordNet. (vii) The head words of the preposition phrases that cover each event, respectively. And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks. In the future, more data can be collected and used with advanced techniques such as ILP (Do et al., 2012), structured learning (Ning et al., 2017) or multi-sieve .  Table 6: Performance of the proposed baseline system on MATRES. Line \"Original\" is the same system retrained on the original TB-Dense and tested on the same subset of event pairs. Due to the limited number of equal examples, the system did not make any equal predictions on the testset.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_metadata": "Authors: Ella Rabinovich, Masih Sultani, S.

Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_metadata": "Authors: Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Roberto Navigli | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

For machines to achieve this capability, they must be able to acquire relevant and correct commonsense for an unbounded set of situations. In this work, we cast commonsense acquisition as knowledge base construction and investigate whether large-scale language models can effectively learn to generate the knowledge  necessary to automatically construct a commonsense knowledge base (KB). Automatic KB construction is a long-standing goal of artificial intelligence research due to the difficulty of achieving high concept coverage in high-precision curated KBs (Lenat, 1995;Miller, 1995). Previous work has developed models capable of reading and extracting semi-structured text (Suchanek et al., 2007;Hoffart et al., 2013;Auer et al., 2007;Bollacker et al., 2008) and unstructured text (Dong et al., 2014;Carlson et al., 2010;Nakashole et al., 2011Nakashole et al., , 2012Niu, 2012) into relational schemas that can be queried for downstream applications. A common thread of these approaches, however, is the focus on encyclopedic knowledge, which lends itself to a well-defined space of entities and relations that can be modeled.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_metadata": "Authors: Vania Mendoncca, Ricardo Rei, Lu\u00edsa Coheur, Alberto Sardinha, Ana L'ucia Santos INESC-ID Lisboa, Instituto Superior T'ecnico, AI Unbabel, C.

Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. We explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence, where the evidence for each candidate is based on a small set of strong relations, rather than relations to all other entities in the document. The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB.

As a starting point we rely on models' ability to display this type of knowledge, but our question differs importantly from that work: we are not asking whether models can recall facts about the real world from training-rather, we are trying to gauge the extent to which models form robust representations of new information presented in input after training. Somewhat more similar to ours is work like Elazar et al. (2021), which explores the consistency of models' generation of facts in the face of rephrasing of prompts. The basic intuition behind this work-that LMs' ability to make intelligent-looking predictions can be sensitive to the particulars of the context-is one that we also use as we ask more specific questions about models' processing of information in their input.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_metadata": "Authors: B.

These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex. Human evaluation also proves that our model is able to generate relevant and informative questions.", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_metadata": "Authors: Prafulla Kumar Choubey, A.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

In this work, we aim to provide task distributions for meta-learning by considering self-supervised tasks automatically proposed from unlabeled text, to enable large-scale meta-learning in NLP. We design multiple distributions of self-supervised tasks by considering important aspects of task diversity, difficulty, type, domain, and curriculum, and investigate how they affect meta-learning performance.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%.

Our model builds upon the recent work on Noisy Student Training, a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the idea of self-training.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models.

We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

Such feedback does not always represent explicit user preferences about content, but rather is used as a way to overcome training issues of recommender systems.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_metadata": "Authors: Jiapeng Wang, Lianwen Jin, Kai Ding | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_metadata": "Authors: James Fiacco, Samridhi Choudhary, C.

Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_metadata": "Authors: Motohiro Makiguchi, Daisuke Sakamoto, H.

Cheng et al. [31] found that a higher number of downvotes across multiple social media platforms resulted in worsening the quality of discourse, while a higher count of positive reactions did not improve discourse significantly. Warut Khern-am-nuai et al. [71] showed that after removing downvoting in a popular public forum, the number of both posts and replies significantly increased. Furthermore they found a decrease in toxicity and an increase in the diversity of replies. Shmargad et al. [109] demonstrated that upvoting incivility incentivized users to generate more toxic content. In a field experiment, Matias et al. [81,88] showed that hiding downvotes increased the percentage of commenters who had not been vocal on political subreddits before. On Twitter, Adelani et al. [1] demonstrated that user feedback expressed as likes and retweets significantly affected topic continuation in discussions. Stroud et al. [114] concluded that the type of feedback that users gave by pressing a button (recommend, like, respect) altered the frequency and the scope of its use (see also [115]). Focusing on Reddit, Graham et al. [53] found that indeed users rarely use the voting reaction mechanisms as community guidelines dictate. Generalizing, Hayes et al. [61] found that users interpreted and applied the same reaction mechanism differently, depending on system, social, and structural factors.

However, designing an effective interview chatbot is non-trivial. Few tools exist to help designers design, evaluate, and improve an interview chatbot iteratively. Based on a formative study and literature reviews, we propose a computational framework for quantifying the performance of interview chatbots. Incorporating the framework, we have developed iChatProfile, an assistive chatbot design tool that can automatically generate a profile of an interview chatbot with quantified performance metrics and offer design suggestions for improving the chatbot based on such metrics. To validate the effectiveness of iChatProfile, we designed and conducted a between-subject study that compared the performance of 10 interview chatbots designed with or without using iChatProfile. Based on the live chats between the 10 chatbots and 1349 users, our results show that iChatProfile helped the designers build significantly more effective interview chatbots, improving both interview quality and user experience.", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_6": "Since our formative study indicated that chatbot designers wish to obtain certain quantitative feedback on the performance of their existing chatbot (T1), we first formulated a computational framework that quantitatively measures the effectiveness of such an interview chatbot from multiple aspects. The framework aims at achieving two goals: 1) providing quantified insights into the performance of an interview chatbot; 2) using such insights to provide specific and practical design suggestions for improving the chatbot. Based on the previous work on assessing human interviews [3,7,15,20,24,50], communication theories for conducting effective interviews [47,67], and evaluating chatbot effectiveness [12,19,55,65,70], we formulated a set of performance metrics to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of an interview chatbot from three main dimensions: elicitation ability, user experience, and ethics.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_para_1": "Dialogue generation is an important research topic in NLP, thus many approaches have been proposed to address this task. Most earlier works made use of a predefined template (Lemon et al., 2006;Wang and Lemon, 2013) to generate dialogues. More recently, deep neural networks have been used for building end-to-end architectures capable of generating questions (Vinyals and Le, 2015;Sordoni et al., 2015) and also for the task of goal-oriented dialogue generation (Rajendran et al., 2018;Bordes et al., 2017). Visual dialogue focuses on having a conversation about an image with either one or both of the agents being a machine. Since its inception (Das et al., 2017), different approaches have been proposed to address this problem (Massiceti et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2017;Das et al., 2017). Goaloriented Visual Dialogue, on the other hand, is an area that has only been introduced fairly recently. De Vries et al.  proposed the GuessWhat?! dataset for goal-oriented visual dialogue while Strub et al.  developed a reinforcement learning approach for Figure 2: A block diagram of our model. The framework is trained on top of three individual models: the questioner (QGen), the guesser, and the oracle. The guesser returns an object distribution given a history of question-answer pairs that are generated by the questioner and the oracle respectively. These distributions are used for calculating the information gain of the question-answer pair. The information gain and distribution of probabilities given by the Guesser are used either as a reward or optimized as a loss function with global rewards for training the questioner.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_abstract": "While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

It receives increasing attentions from research communities recently, due to its broad applications in scenarios of dialogue system and educational reading comprehension (Piwek et al., 2007;. It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text. One possible reason causing the problem is that current sequenceto-sequence models learn a latent representation for the input text without explicitly modeling semantic information included. We therefore argue that modeling facts in the input text can help to alleviate the problem of existing neural QG models.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_7": "The primary task of interview chatbots is to elicit high-quality responses from participants.

We thus model an interview chatbot's elicitation abilities from two sub-dimensions: response quality and user engagement. While response quality directly assesses the quality of user responses to an interview question, the level of user engagement quantifies how much a participant is engaged with a chatbot from multiple aspects (e.g., how long an engagement is).", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

For example, Bohus and Rudnicky introduce dialog systems that gather required information for performing specific tasks (e.g., making travel reservations) [4].

For example, a chatbot is built to interview students for effective teaming [66] and another chatbot to interview gamers for eliciting their game opinions [67]. Williams et al. have developed a chatbot to interview employees for workplace productivity [64]. Compared to traditional, static online surveys, these interview chatbots enhance information elicitation [31,66] by providing interactive feedback [8] and asking follow-up questions [46]. Our work is directly related to the efforts of creating interview chatbots. However, existing work focuses on developing interview chatbots for specific information elicitation tasks (e.g., [64,66,67]) or powering interview chatbots with specific skills (e.g., giving them a personality [71] and active listening skills [65]).

We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_metadata": "Authors: Yunli Wang, Yu Wu, Lili Mou, Zhoujun Li, Wen-Han Chao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_metadata": "Authors: Meishan Zhang, Zhang Meishan, Zhang Yue, Fu Guo-hong | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_metadata": "Authors: S.

We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function.

Coherence models for entity resolution encourage all referring expressions in a document to resolve to entities that are related in the KB. We explore attention-like mechanisms for coherence, where the evidence for each candidate is based on a small set of strong relations, rather than relations to all other entities in the document. The rationale is that document-wide support may simply not exist for non-salient entities, or entities not densely connected in the KB. Our proposed sys-tem outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the CoNLL 2003, TAC KBP 2010, 2011 and 2012 tasks.", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_metadata": "Authors: Antoine Bosselut, Hannah Rashkin, Maarten Sap, Chaitanya Malaviya, Asli Celikyilmaz, Yejin Choi | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_2": "Our system uses mention and context models similar to those of Lazic et al.

In particular, we achieve a 20% relative reduction in error from Chisholm and Hachey (2015) on CoNLL, and a 22% error reduction from Cucerzan (2012) on TAC 2012.

We propose a novel way to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. Our model uses two softmax layers in order to predict the next word in conditional language models: one predicts the location of a word in the source sentence, and the other predicts a word in the shortlist vocabulary. At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_4": "Attention is in general used to attend on the most important part of texts, and has been successfully applied in machine translation (Luong et al.), question answering (Xiong et al., 2016) and parsing (Dozat and Manning, 2016), and is adopted in our model for attending on important sentences as evidence. Our work is also related to coherence modeling. Different from traditional coherence studies focusing on discourse coherence among sentences that are widely applied in text generation (Park and Kim, 2015; Kiddon et al., 2016) and summarization (Logeswaran et al., 2018), we try to capture evidential sentences topically coherent not only among themselves but also with respect to the target claim.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

Previous studies showed that co-present others react more negatively to smartphone use (than, e.g., to reading a magazine) since they cannot directly understand the nature and the goal of the on-screen activity [55,69]. An example of a design solution for this problem is \"social displays,\" additional displays attached to the backside of the mobile device and revealing the user's current application [44]. The current study supports these previous fndings and design solutions by showing some of the ways in which co-present others return smartphone users back into interactions, for example, by commenting on the on-screen activity or by enquiring the smartphone user about the type of activity. As smartphones' screens are of low visibility due to their size, additional audio or video cues can be a good solution for increasing activity awareness for co-present others.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_metadata": "Authors: Shan Randhawa, Tallal Ahmad, Jay Chen, Agha Ali Raza | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference, Review", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_0": "Smartphones have become an integral part of people's daily lives in many countries around the world. Recent studies have shown that mobile technology use is embedded in various everyday activities [8,49,74,79]. Consequently, researchers have raised concerns about the negative efects of pervasive smartphone use on the quality of face-to-face interactions [2,20,80], hence the term phubbing (phone snubbing), which refers to situations when co-present others are overshadowed by smartphone use. So far, most of the existing studies on smartphone use have been based on surveys, interviews, or data collected in experimental settings. One problem with these approaches is that they often fail to take the interactional context of smartphone use into account. The generalizability of much-published research on this issue is also problematic, as the mainstream approaches do not consider when, how, and by whom smartphone use is initiated (i.e., its communicational motivation) and how co-present others then react to this. The necessity to analyze smartphone use in real-life contexts has been recently emphasized [15,37], but relatively few studies have focused on smartphone use in natural communication settings [21,53,71].", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_2": "This study contributes to HCI by advancing our understanding and explicating some nuances of self-initiated individual smartphone use in co-present interactions. We show that the type of smartphone-based activity and the interactional context afect the way in which a particular instance of smartphone use is designed and oriented to by other participants. Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75]. By analyzing naturally occurring interactions, this study seeks to identify issues with existing defnitions of phubbing and ofers a new conceptualization for future research. As this study also investigates participants' practices of returning smartphone users back into conversations, we conclude the paper with design implications, aiming to support participants' practices for dealing with extended smartphone use.", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

The second block shows representative annotation projection models, including MX14 (Ma and Xia, 2014), RC15 (Rasooli and Collins, 2015), LA16. The models of annotation projection can be complementary with our work, since they build target training corpus from raw parallel texts.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model. As expected, performance is lower on the Live Chat Customer Service corpus.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_abstract": "This paper addresses the automatic recognition of telicity, an aspectual notion. A telic event includes a natural endpoint (\u201cshe walked home\u201d), while an atelic event does not (\u201cshe walked around\u201d). Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work. We also create a new data set of English texts manually annotated with telicity.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_para_1": "Existing work on cross-lingual transfer can be classified into two categories.

The second category, 1 https://github.com/zhangmeishan/CodeMixedTreebank namely annotation projection, aims to produce a set of large-scale training instances full of automatic dependencies by parsing parallel sentences (Hwa et al., 2005;Rasooli and Collins, 2015).

Studies also showed that smartphone use can be encouraged in situations when it enriches the ongoing activity, for example, taking pictures and videos, sharing memes, and putting on music [51]. As smartphones can both constrain and enable co-present interactions, we should design solutions that would not limit participants' opportunities to use technology as a resource for interaction. In addition, we should consider designing technology that supports participants' own strategies for managing smartphone use and its potential negative efects on co-present interactions.", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_metadata": "Authors: Ryan Louie, Andy Coenen, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Michael Terry, Carrie J.

Today, a virtual haptic technology that uses vibration to convey the click feeling is used at a practical level [Fukumoto andSugimura. 2001, Kim andLee. 2013]. The user can customize the strength of the feedback configuring the vibration. However, it is not suitable for presenting where the button is, or what the shape of the button is. For those matters, it seems smarter to use a Tangible User Interface. The capacitive sensors of the touch device can be used for recognition of the position, size, and orientation of the passive objects [Chan et al. 2012]. However, it is hard to customize the haptic feedback because most approaches use the elasticity or rigidity of the passive material itself.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_metadata": "Authors: Maitraye Das, Brent J.

The systems automatically generate interfaces through a branchand-bound optimisation technique that is flexible enough to adapt to various objectives by modifying the underlying cost function. Our work differs from this line of work in three key aspects: (1) Input: SUPPLE and its descendants require functional specifications as input. This is beneficial for application developers as they only need to specify what functions are exposed to users. On the contrary, our work targets UI designers who already have some ideas about desired layouts. It enables designers to define the design task by demonstration, including element types, and preferences regarding size and placement. (2) Layouting: When rendering an interface layout, SUPPLE used three heuristics to sequentially decide the layout -bottom-up, top-down, and minimum remaining values [22]. The key objective was to find a layout that satisfies user preferences, abilities, and device constraints. In contrast, our MILP formulation aims at constructing well-formed grid layouts, with desirable aesthetics, by considering the entire composition of the canvas. (3) Output: SUPPLE and others aim at producing a single point-optimal design for end-users. In contrast, our MILP approach generates multiple diverse solutions for mixed-initiative design tools.", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_metadata": "Authors: Byungjoo Lee, Antti Oulasvirta | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: Book, JournalArticle, Conference", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_metadata": "Authors: A.

The first emphasises the issues that arise from implementations which are disconnected from the social, cultural, and physical attributes that are unique to the African context. The second suggests HCI methods that incorporate indigenous concepts in order to make research outputs relevant to end users [57]. In this regard, HCI has been examined through the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu and its philosophical underpinnings have been used as a structural basis which grants situated orientation [58] and provides a relevant framework for design innovation, technology use, its adoption, and how it can drive business innovation in Africa. In recent years, HCI has gained traction in Africa with a strong emphasis on opportunities availed by mobile technologies and increased access to internet and affordability of devices. This has led to great emphasis on design and deployment of usercentered digital solutions that are enmeshed with the needs of an African audience to solve African problems. Building on this work, this paper thus situates itself not in a development discourse -where the researcher designs from an assumption that the non-western community is in need of development and would unquestionably benefit from western technologies [8] -but instead from an afro-centric discourse where knowledge and innovation from the continent is legitimate and equal to others, and can spark innovation and problem-solving in similar contexts on and off the continent.", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_metadata": "Authors: Teresa Almeida, R.

Most existing studies in this area use quantitative methods that do not take interactional context into account [11], and it has been recently suggested that smartphone use should be analyzed in the context of participants' daily environments [24,52,87]. While prior HCI studies have elucidated many important aspects of collaborative smartphone use [8-10, 74, 75], self-initiated individual smartphone use has received much less attention. This study contributes to the body of HCI literature by uncovering and describing common patterns of individual smartphone use in everyday co-present interactions. Our fndings demonstrate when and how young adults themselves initiate, carry out, and terminate individual smartphone use when interacting with others. Below, we summarize the key fndings, situate them within previous research and present implications for HCI. We discuss the role of context in the way smartphone use is initiated, factors afecting whether smartphone use is carried out as a temporarily prioritized or as a parallel activity, reasons for reciprocating one's smartphone use and participants' strategies for managing extended smartphone use. The analysis of naturally occurring interactions also allows us to respecify phubbing and suggest guidelines for further research. Drawing on participants' practices of managing extended smartphone use, we propose how the design of mobile technologies can better facilitate social interactions.

However, achieving true behavioral change is difcult for most adults: most of the employed technology and algorithms reinforce current habits and mimic the behavior of others [25,71]. Hence, it is argued that we need a new breed of virtues that can be potentially developed through technology [79]. To achieve this, our impact on the environment should be made more tangible for us to want to develop virtuous actions we have not considered before.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_metadata": "Authors: Xu Han, Michelle X.

WFSAs and hidden Markov models 19 were once popular in automatic speech recognition (Hetherington, 2004;Moore et al., 2006;Hoffmeister et al., 2012) 19 HMMs are a special case of WFSAs (Mohri et al., 2002). and remain popular in morphology (Dreyer, 2011;Cotterell et al., 2015). Most closely related to this work, neural networks have been combined with weighted finite-state transducers to do morphological reinflection (Rastogi et al., 2016). These prior works learn a single FSA or FST, whereas our model learns a collection of simple but complementary FSAs, together encoding a sequence. We are the first to incorporate neural networks both before WFSAs (in their transition scoring functions), and after (in the function that turns their vector of scores into a final prediction), to produce an expressive model that remains interpretable.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_metadata": "Authors: Prafulla Kumar Choubey, A.

In this paper we present SoPa, a new model that aims to bridge these two approaches. SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_metadata": "Authors: Tianfu Zhang, Heyan Huang, Chong Feng, Longbing Cao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining robustness of models\u2019 ability to deploy relevant context information in the face of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use of critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how robustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We also systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light on dynamics of models\u2019 use of contextual cues. We find that although models appear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and applying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but irrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In particular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic similarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues, rather than by robust representations of context meaning.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_para_0": "In this paper, we identify that the task of masked language modeling, used ubiquitously in recent years for pretraining other downstream tasks (Peters et al., 2018;Howard and Ruder, 2018;Liu et al., 2019) lends itself directly to missing sign prediction in the transliterated texts.

In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency.

Somewhat more similar to ours is work like Elazar et al. (2021), which explores the consistency of models' generation of facts in the face of rephrasing of prompts.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_1": "A recent trend is that researchers are trying to establish more objective tasks and evidence-based verification solutions, which focus on the use of evidence obtained from more reliable sources, e.g., encyclopedia articles, verified news, etc., as an important distinguishing factor (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018). Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_7": "After pre-training, all the model parameters are trained end-to-end by minimizing the squared error between the class probability distribution of the prediction and that of the ground truth over the claims.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules. Similar pipelines were developed by most of the participating teams (Nie et al., 2019;Padia et al., 2018;Alhindi et al., 2018;Hanselowski et al., 2018) in FEVER shared task (Thorne et al., 2018b).

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours.

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

The spirit of this design was aligned with the findings of past research that have shown the efficacy of VR in training functional skills for autistic individuals [14,16,41,89]. Despite our intended goal, we found that VR technology designed to develop the social and communication skills of autistic people has the potential to be misused to correct their characteristics and enforce normative behaviors from the perspective of a neurotypical society. This finding reveals important design implications that HCI researchers should consider when designing technology to develop autistic people's social communication skills.

Recent studies have proposed the exploitation of sensors integrated with VR platforms (e.g., eye-trackers and motion trackers) to detect users' affective states in real-time [74,97]. Previous studies examining sensor integration have focused on collecting behavioral and physiological data in VR-based data-driven interventions. For example, vrSocial's use of visualization of proximity, voice volume, and speech duration of autistic children in real-time within virtual spaces was an effective way for the children to better regulate their proximity in VR [13]. Another VR-based system correlated children's physiological signals with their affective states while participating in given social tasks, which resulted in a VRbased system that was adaptive to participants' performance [48]. With VR, user data such as voice volume or affective state can be collected while they interact in the virtual environments, while stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, professionals, co-workers) can contribute to the learning process [5,[57][58][59]. Thus, such user-generated data could facilitate information sharing, perspective-taking, and communication among both autistic people and other stakeholders [77].", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_metadata": "Authors: Luis A.

Furthermore, the flexible and scalable nature of VR can manipulate environments and interactions tailored to autistic people to provide personalized interventions for people with various levels of cognition, language, and social skills [62]. Based on these advantages, VR-based interventions can be applied to a range of domains such as socio-emotional skills [24], safety skills [40,81,82], adaptive skills [49], and communication [24,43].", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_metadata": "Authors: Matthias Hohmann, Lisa Konieczny, Michelle Hackl, Brian Wirth, Talha Zaman, R.

To present the concept, we created a video prototype of the Workplace Playbook VR. The concept presented in the video prototype primarily targeted autistic people to support their work-related social and communication skills. We made this design decision because VR has been shown to be effective for training the social and communication skills of autistic individuals [41]. Those skills are known to be some of the most pressing challenges that autistic people face in workplaces [18,33,65]. However, as we will report in the findings section, our study revealed that such social and communication skills training VR programs have the potential to enforce \"normative behaviors\" on autistic people rather than respect their values and diversity. Moreover, to advance the positive work experiences of autistic employees in workplaces, we found the importance of practicing design interventions not only for neurodiverse people but also for neurotypical co-workers and employees. Therefore, this work ultimately offers VR design spaces of workplace environments for two target groups-autistic people and members of their community and their neurotypical coworkers.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_metadata": "Authors: Nusrat Jahan Mim | Venue: International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_metadata": "Authors: Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, He Huang, Xi Chen, Q.

Previous research on VR and empathy has shown that people who underwent a virtual reality experience simulating life events such as becoming homeless were likely to have a positive attitude toward the homeless and present pro-social behaviors (e.g., sign petitions) [37]. Empathy-building among family, professionals, and co-workers is also critical for autistic people to have pleasant work experiences [33]. Building on the previous research, we investigate how VR systems can be designed to successfully mediate communication between autistic people and members of their support network, who can help address whatever issues and concerns autistic individuals may have regarding workplace social situations. Only a few studies have examined the use of VR technologies to facilitate functional communication between autistic people and caregivers (e.g., teachers, family members, and therapists). For example, studies have used a monitoring module that allows caregivers to observe a learner's VR situations in real-time and adjust task levels and scenarios accordingly to provide appropriate feedback [60,75]. In another study, a therapist directly participated in a VR situation as a peer character, providing responses and feedback tailored to the behaviors of autistic people [24].", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_metadata": "Authors: E.

Generally it requires labeled data from the source and only unlabeled data from the target to learn such representations. While these representations act like a bridge to transfer knowledge learned in the source to the target; they may lead to negative transfer when the source specific characteristics detract their ability to represent the target data. We present a novel neural network architecture to simultaneously learn a two-part representation which is based on the principle of segregating source specific representation from the common representation. The first part captures the source specific characteristics while the second part captures the truly common representation. Our architecture optimizes an objective function which acts adversarial for the source specific part if it contributes towards the cross-domain learning. We empirically show that two parts of the representation, in different arrangements, outperforms existing learning algorithms on the source learning as well as cross-domain tasks on multiple datasets.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_metadata": "Authors: H.

There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015). Recently, neural architectures have been shown effective in such a task, whereby minimal feature engineering is required (Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Peters et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Domain adaptation, as a special case for transfer learning, aims to exploit the abundant data of wellstudied source domains to improve the performance in target domains of interest (Pan and Yang, 2010;Weiss et al., 2016). There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain. The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process. Figure 1 illustrates the two approaches based on the BLSTM-CRF (bidirectional LSTM augmented with a CRF layer) architecture for NER.
