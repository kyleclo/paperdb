Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).",

However, large language model pre-training costs intensive computational resources, and most of the models are trained from scratch without reusing the existing pre-trained models, which is wasteful. In this paper, we propose bert2BERT, which can effectively transfer the knowledge of an existing smaller pre-trained model to a large model through parameter initialization and significantly improve the pre-training efficiency of the large model. Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving method proposed in computer vision on the Transformer-based language model, and further improve it by proposing a novel method, advanced knowledge for large model\u2019s initialization. In addition, a two-stage learning method is proposed to further accelerate the pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments on representative PLMs (e.g., BERT and GPT) and demonstrate that (1) our method can save a significant amount of training cost compared with baselines including learning from scratch, StackBERT and MSLT; (2) our method is generic and applicable to different types of pre-trained models. In particular, bert2BERT saves about 45% and 47% computational cost of pre-training BERT_{\\rm BASE} and GPT_{\\rm BASE} by reusing the models of almost their half sizes.", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_para_1": "Efficient Pre-training in NLP. The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work. Some works (Gong et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020;Gu et al., 2021) propose progressive learning to accelerate the pre-training, which are motivated by the fact that different layers have some similar knowledge (e.g., attention patterns). They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next.

It is deployed by using three models in the pipeline for comparison with our ORConvQA system, which employs a MTL of the reranker and reader.

We propose a novel way to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. Our model uses two softmax layers in order to predict the next word in conditional language models: one predicts the location of a word in the source sentence, and the other predicts a word in the shortlist vocabulary. At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_12": "Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has increasingly become a popular approach for tackling several tasks in a uniform model .

We mine translations from monolingual CommonCrawl data processed as described above for self-supervised MLM pretraining. After processing, there are 1.17B, 0.6B, 7.73B sentences for Chinese (zh), German (de), and English (en), respectively. LaBSE embeddings are used to pair each non-English sentence with its nearest English neighbor, dropping pairs with a similarity score < 0.6. 20 For en-de and en-zh, we train a model with Transformer-Big (Vaswani et al., 2017) in the following way: First we train the model on the mined data as is for 120k steps with batch size 10k. Then we select the best 20% using Wang  Results in table 7 show the effectiveness of the mined training data. By referencing previous results (Edunov et al., 2018), we see that the model using the en-de mined data yields performance that is only 2.8 BLEU away from performance of the best system that made use of the official WMT17 en-de parallel data. Compare to prior en-zh results (Sennrich et al., 2017), we see that our model using mined en-zh training data is as good as a WMT17 NMT model that is trained on the official WMT en-zh parallel data.

BERT proposed the Next Sentence Prediction task (NSP) which predicts whether two given text segments are from the same documents or not. The results of SpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2020) question the value of NSP, suggesting this might be due to noise from merging 2 unrelated texts from different documents. Consequently, ALBERT (Lan et al., 2019) and StructBERT (Wang et al., 2019) added sentence ordering objectives by predicting the order of text segments. BART (Lewis et al., 2020) proposed the Sentence Permutation task which is similar with ours.

The interpretation process enables investigation of which identified functional groups correspond to linguistic or task level heuristics that may be employed in well understood non-neural methods for performing the task. Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models. This approach builds on and extends prior work using linguistic and task knowledge to understand the behavior and the results of modern neural models (Shi et al., 2016b;Adi et al., 2016;Conneau et al., 2018)."}}

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_abstract": "Claim verification is generally a task of verifying the veracity of a given claim, which is critical to many downstream applications. It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent pieces of evidence, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidence as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_4": "Several systems (Milne and Witten, 2008;Kulkarni et al., 2009;Hoffart et al., 2011) use the \"Milne and Witten\" measure for relatedness between a pair of entities, which is based on the number of Wikipedia articles citing each entity page, and the number of articles citing both; Cucerzan (2007) has also relied on the Wikipedia category structure. Internal links from one entity page to another in Wikipedia also provide direct evidence of relatedness between them. Another (possibly more noisy) source of information are Web pages containing links (Singh et al., 2012) to Wikipedia pages of both entities. Such links have been used in several recent systems (Cheng and Roth, 2013;Chisholm and Hachey, 2015). Yamada et al. (2016) train embedding vectors for entities, and use them to define similarities.", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_1": "A recent trend is that researchers are trying to establish more objective tasks and evidence-based verification solutions, which focus on the use of evidence obtained from more reliable sources, e.g., encyclopedia articles, verified news, etc., as an important distinguishing factor (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018). Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision."}}

Current speech generating devices (SGD) used for AAC offer little in the way of allowing users to control the expressive nature of the speech rendered from the user's input [11]. This is surprising given that advances in speech synthesis technologies over the past decade have resulted in the development of text-to-speech (TTS) engines capable of rendering speech that exhibits a range of emotions (e.g., CereProc [4], Nuance Loquendo [18], and IBM Watson [30] are commercial speech engines capable of emotional speech synthesis). Additionally, most TTS engines accept Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2] as input, allowing for a degree of control over prosodic features such as the rate of speech, the pitch of the voice, and cadence/pacing of words. The fact that these advances have yet to be incorporated into SGDs in a meaningful way is a major issue for AAC. Recent work such as that of Higginbotham [9], Kane et. al. [11], and Pullin et al. [22] has described the importance of this issue and the need to develop better AAC systems capable of more expressive speech, but to date, there are no research or commercially available AAC devices that provide advanced expressive speech capabilities, with a majority only allowing for basic modification of speech parameters (overall rate and volume) that cannot be varied on-the-fly (as utterances are constructed and played), while not leveraging the capabilities available in modern TTS engines.", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing, but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs, we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing.

The tone authoring process was explored through the ToneTable art piece, which accepts speech audio as input and allows ablebodied users to physically manipulate the tone of that speech [1]. While ToneTable provoked critical thought around the expressivity of speech, it was not a system designed for AAC, or intended to be used by people with speech impairments. Pauletto et. al. [19] investigated the design space of integrating emotional TTS into conversational bot systems. They proposed a brief set of possible design approaches for creating an interface for marking up text with speech attributes, though these design suggestions were not intended for use by AAC device users (i.e., design suggestions involving direct manipulation likely will not work well for an eye-gaze user).

Synthesizing human-quality expressivity in synthetic speech is still an open problem, but significant advances have been made. Speech engines such as Pitrelli et. al.'s [20] have the ability to render speech that listeners can identify as exhibiting several different tones (e.g., \"conveying bad news\" or \"asking yes-no questions\"). Several commercial engines such as the IBM Watson [28], CereVoice [4], and Nuance Loquendo [18] allow for the rendering of emotional synthesized speech. Each of these systems is similar in allowing developers to select between a small set of emotional categories when rendering speech (e.g., CereVoice supports a default voice in addition to \"happy,\" \"sad,\" \"calm,\" and \"cross\"). Recent developments on the MaryTTS engine (an open-source TTS research platform) [14] have extended beyond simply accepting the specification of emotional categories, allowing for emotional tones to be specified with continuous values for emotional dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance [5]. In addition to allowing for the high-level specification of a tone of voice, each of these TTS engines also supports low-level speech modifications through the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2]. SSML is an XML-based language for specifying prosodic information such as the rate of speech, volume, baseline pitch, emphasized words, and pauses.", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

As such, we invite HCI practitioners to use peripheral awareness as a neurological state to better understand how we can support human performance in other areas within HCI, such as: health and wellbeing, critical systems, sports, and creative and collaborative work, to name just a few. Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance.

This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_abstract": "In this work we introduce peripheral awareness as a neurological state for real-time human-computer integration, where the human is assisted by a computer to interact with the world.

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_2": "These studies show that human-computer integration in an exertion context has focused on systems that can react to the user's actions (focusing \"on\" the user's body -e.g., [3,26]), and on the user's environment (focusing \"around\" the user's body -e.g., [4,17,59]), to support and facilitate new user experiences. What appears to be missing in this vibrant design space is systems that draw from the \"inside\" of the user's body to explore inner bodily processes as mechanisms of integration. As a result, we consider changes to the field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a valuable mechanism for integration between the user and the system as it is linked with human performance [32,44,45].", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_metadata": "Authors: Mitchell Stern, Jacob Andreas, D.

To enable computational modeling of news structures, we apply an existing theory of functional discourse structure for news articles that revolves around the main event and create a human-annotated corpus of 802 documents spanning over four domains and three media sources. Next, we propose several document-level neural-network models to automatically construct news content structures. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating system predicted news structures yields new state-of-the-art performance for event coreference resolution. The news documents we annotated are openly available and the annotations are publicly released for future research.", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_metadata": "Authors: Arjun Reddy Akula, Spandana Gella, Keze Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Siva Reddy | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_abstract": "In this work, we present a minimal neural model for constituency parsing based on independent scoring of labels and spans. We show that this model is not only compatible with classical dynamic programming techniques, but also admits a novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of the input. We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the French Treebank (82.23 F1).", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_0": "This method, which can be applied simply in a purely post-hoc analysis, independent of the training process, can enable both understanding of individual models and comparison across models. The interpretation process enables investigation of which identified functional groups correspond to linguistic or task level heuristics that may be employed in well understood non-neural methods for performing the task. Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models. This approach builds on and extends prior work using linguistic and task knowledge to understand the behavior and the results of modern neural models (Shi et al., 2016b;Adi et al., 2016;Conneau et al., 2018).", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_3": "On the other hand, Nogueira et al. (2020) proposed monoT5, a text generation model, which was fine-tuned to generate the tokens \"true\" or \"false\" depending on whether the document is relevant or not to the query. Indeed, the monoT5 model has been shown to outperform BERT-based models in passage reranking (Nogueira et al., 2020). In addition, many studies (Raffel et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020; have focused on developing a generative reader which is fine-tuned as a text generation model to extract the answer from the passage. In particular, Khashabi et al. (2020) introduced the UnifiedQA model, which has been shown to yield impressive performances on many extractive QA datasets. However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has combined monoT5 and UnifiedQA by sharing a single text generation model, in order to directly extract the answers instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_8": "Document Retrieval.

We have used the following standard IR benchmark datasets: 1) WT2G 18 along with standard relevance assessments and topics (401 -450), 2) TREC HARD (denoted as HARD) 19 , 3) AQUAINT-2 (AQUT) 20 where we considered only the document-level relevance assessments, and 4) LETOR OHSUMED (OHS) 21 , which consists of 45 features along with query-document pairs with relevance judgments in five folds. We have obtained the raw documents and queries 22 of this dataset, from which we can learn the document representations. As baselines, we have considered the following methods: 1) TF-IDF, 2) LDA (Blei et al., 2003), 3) HDP (Teh et al., 2005), 4) movMF (Banerjee et al., 2005), 5) sHDP (Batmanghelich et al., 2016), 6) GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), 7) WeMAP (Jameel et al., 2019), 8) Skip-gram, and 9) CBOW word embedding models (Mikolov et al., 2013b).", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_4": "ProgVGAT  integrates programs and execution into a natural language inference model. This method uses a verbalization with a program execution model to accumulate evidences and constructs a graph attention network to combine various evidences. Tapas (Herzig et al., 2020) extends BERT with additional structure-aware positional embeddings to represent the tables. Eisenschlos et al., 2020 further pre-train Tapas on counterfactually-augmented and grammar-based synthetic statements. Schlichtkrull et al., 2021 study table-based fact verification in an open-domain setting, and combine a TF-IDF retrieval model with a RoBERTabased joint reranking-and-verification model. Tapex  guides the pre-trained BART model to mimic an SQL executor via an execution-centric table pre-training approach. The pre-training corpus of Tapex is synthesized via sampling SQL queries from the SQUALL dataset (Shi et al., 2020). SaMoE (Zhou et al., 2022) develops a mixtureof-experts network based on the RoBERTa-large model (Liu et al., 2019). The MoE network consists of different experts, and then a management module decides the contribution of each expert network to the verification result. Volta (Gautam et al., 2021) analyzes how transfer learning and standardizing tables to contain a single header row can boost the effectiveness of tablebased fact verification.

In the case of the word embedding models, we create document vectors in the same way as we do for our model, by simply replacing the role of target word vectors with document word vectors. In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations. We tuned the dimensionality of the embedding from the pool {100, 150, 200} and the number of vMF mixture components from the pool {200, 500, 800}.", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_para_3": "2) I heard the pulse of the besieging sea throb far away all night.

More specifically, the presence of decorations such as labels and tick marks can be added to give information about the gradations along the scale and allow for more precise and repeatable selections [35]. While such visual attributes have been studied in detail for the labelling of discrete scales [38], their impact on VASs, and their effect on the distribution of collected responses has not been rigorously examined. 2 Our work explores if and how visual design variations of VASs impacts the results obtained from web-based collection systems. We perform a 2,000 user, 250,000 trial Mechanical Turk experiment, to study the impact of slider decorations on VAS responses. We test a number of design variations that involve the mark-up of the slider scale with tick marks, labels, and other decorations. We provide a thorough analysis of the collected results, which help identify designs which should be avoided due to the induced bias in responses. Furthermore, through the use of two separate experimental tasks, we are able to analyze the tradeoffs between bias, accuracy, and speed-of-use.", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_para_5": "Developing a set of stimuli to use as a test of rating behaviour is a difficult and well-studied problem [33].

Our task is modelled on the task used by Neely and Borg to test the performance of a VAS compared to a graduated Likert scale [15]. A collection of 50 shades of grey ( Figure 2) were selected in perceptually equal steps between white and black according to the CIE L*a*b* colour space [3].

Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models.

In order to build a traditional modular-based dialog system, researchers first identify the semantic representation, such as the dialog acts and slots in user utterances. Then they accumulate these semantic representations over time to track the dialog state. Finally they apply RL to learn an optimized dialog policy given the dialog state (Raux et al., 2005;Shi and Yu, 2018). Such modular-based dialog systems are effective in narrow task domains, such as searching a bus route schedule and reserving a restaurant through natural language, but they fail to generalize to complex settings where the size of the action space increases. Owing to the development of deep learning, RL on neural sequence-to-sequence models has been explored in more complex dialog domains such as open-domain conversation (Li et al., 2016) and negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017). However, due to the difficulty of assigning appropriate rewards when operating in a large action space, these frameworks cannot generate fluent dialog utterances. Zhao et al. (2019) proposed a novel latent action RL framework to marry the advantage of a module based approach and sequence-to-sequence approach. They learned the optimal dialog policy in a complex task-oriented dialog domain while achieving decent conversation quality. We study the similar issue in a multimodal task-oriented dialog scenario. We propose an iterative approach to optimize dialog policy using RL methods and system response generation via SL.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

The method is used to factor a complex neural model into its functional components, which are comprised of sets of co-firing neurons that cut across layers of the network architecture, and which we call neural pathways. The function of these pathways can be understood by identifying correlated task level and linguistic heuristics in such a way that this knowledge acts as a lens for approximating what the network has learned to apply to its intended task. As a case study for investigating the utility of these pathways, we present an examination of pathways identified in models trained for two standard tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Recognizing Textual Entailment.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_4": "In summary, in this work, we investigate the use of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to improve performance on the ORConvQA task by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure. We propose monoQA, which uses a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader. Our model, which is based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) text generation model, is fine-tuned simultaneously for both reranking (in order to improve the precision of the top retrieved passages) and extracting the answer. Unlike previous work, monoQA makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task, followed by the other tokens for the answer extraction task, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Our contributions are summarised as follows: (1) we leverage Multi-Task Learning with a text generation model by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure to effectively addresses the ORConvQA task; (2) using two different ORConvQA datasets, we compare our model to two strong baselines from the literature, and show that our MTL reranker and generative reader approach yields the best F1, Recall, MRR, Figure 2: An example dialog and relevant passages from the ORConvQA dataset (Qu et al., 2020). and MAP performance improvements over the strongest baseline with statistically significant improvements ranging from +5.70% to +23.34%; (3) the proposed MTL model combining the reranker and generative reader significantly outperforms and is twice as fast for inference than the individual application of the monoT5 and UnifiedQA models for reranking and extracting the answer.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_para_3": "2) I heard the pulse of the besieging sea throb far away all night.

The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31]. Users tend to rely more on anticipation (their internal clock) than on reaction when the task becomes more difficult. Although simple, the model adequately addresses two quite different cases:"}}

Not only does this impede a constructive exchange of propositions but, for the demagogue, it renders perspectivetaking of opposing positions irrelevant. The oversimplification of complex social phenomena results in a polarization that facilitates political mobilization [78]. Demagogic talk aims to contrast social groups, highlighting apparent identity differences and putting them in competition with each other. It promises to care for the needs of \"ordinary\" people, creating an ethos around the often hateful division into laypeople and experts, elites and the forgotten, or poor and rich [101,102]. The disregard for truthfulness and the evocation of a collective identity based on hate, fear-mongering, and scapegoating means that demagogic rhetoric necessarily contains emotional linguistic components [57].

Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members.

To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational.

Engaging with the literature on demagogic and civic discourse revealed identity labels to be relevant for these two types of discourse but not deliberative discourse (for demagogic discourse, see [57,63,102]; for civic discourse, see [2,24,60]). However, conceptualizing different identity references for demagogic and civic discourse proved to be challenging and authors disagreed on how to define identity labels for demagoguery and civic engagement. Out of all three political discourse theories, civic engagement is the most contested one. It allows for the most diverse definitions of what it's essential components are (e.g., compare [40] and [24]). We first agreed on a basic identity label to identify comments that expressed the existence of collective or group (i.e., collective rhetoric). One author then proposed an identity label to highlight group differences, a feature of both demagogic and civic discourse [35,60,63]. This label was called \"we vs. them\" to underline the competitive nature of interaction in both demagoguery and civic engagement. In demagogic discourse, members often degrade another group to establish a sense of unity. Here, a unity is formed around group characteristics and people that appear to best embody such characteristics. In short, narratives of unity are not formed around a serious discussion around policy-making to bring about political change but around important personas. This, one author pointed out could be a decisive conceptual distinction between identity in demagoguery and civic discourse. To account for the lack of engagement with policy-making topics to establish a sense of unity (as is the case for civic engagement), we finally agreed on two more identity labels for demagogic discourse: \"you in the epicenter\" and \"who instead of what. \" The first label highlights the importance of a group and why it should be treated preferentially while the second appeals to the characteristics of in-group or out-group members. In civic discourse, we added the labels \"empathy/reciprocity, \" \"counterargument\", and \"situational call to action\" that, together with \"we vs. them, \" would sample comments that expressed a sense of unity but that at the same time featured constructive and productive interactions on specific policy-making goals.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_abstract": "A significant share of political discourse occurs online on social media platforms. Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all.

They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_4": "Our study builds on and significantly extends research studies that have performed first steps towards understanding social media users' political rhetoric. For example, using quantitative interviewing, Semaan et al. [108] investigated whether social media users' interactions could be characterized by deliberative and civic agency. They described deliberation as the presence of reasoned and respectful discussions and civic agency as the ability to interact and participate in the public sphere. Both Friess et al. [48] and Wright et al. [127] developed coding schemes for labeling user content as deliberative based on features such as rationality and constructiveness. Guimaraes et al. [55] formulated the conversational archetypes \"harmony\", \"discrepancy\", \"disruption\", and \"dispute\" to describe online political discourse. Lee et al. [77] connected user behavior on social media such as debating, posting or forwarding news, to features of civic engagement. Connecting online and offline behavior, Hampton et al. [59] investigated the association of social media usage with the level of offline deliberation, which they defined as the propensity to discuss political issues with others. Evidently, prior research that investigates political rhetoric on social media has only used basic conceptualizations of political discourse theories. We see this as an opportunity to perform a more in-depth engagement with scholarship on deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse theories to understand the extent to which their essential components map to political discussions on Reddit.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_10": "This study investigates essential rhetoric components of deliberation, civic engagement, and demagoguery. Foreshadowing stark differences, demagoguery oversimplifies complex societal issues [57,101]. Demagoguery's rhetoric polarization lays the groundwork for action-based political mobilization: you are either with \"us\" or with \"them\" [63,78]. Civic engagement interactions are unstructured and characterized by multiple forms of communication and action, with its discourse being frequently characterized as \"messy conversation\" that facilitates participation [35]. Civic engagement interactions aim to be inclusive -a key goal of civic engagement movements [89]. Deliberation, from a Habermasian perspective, requires intersubjective propositional knowledge between conversation members [20]. That is, knowledge-claims must fulfill standards of intersubjectivity: ideally, all discussants are able to relate to the beliefs that underlie a proposition. Propositions must be grounded in logical plausibility, factual correctness, and communal narratives. Discussants' claims must have pragmatic value (i.e, \"propositionality\") in order to support the group's goal of reaching an understanding. Only when everyone can relate to the proposed statements, can deliberative rhetoric help solve a social, civil, or communal issue that is important to the group [62].", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_2": "The goal of this paper is to describe the factors that led to participation in the reddit blackout. While this paper does not test academic theories of collective action or social movements, it does gesture toward ways that its qualitative and quantitative findings can relate to these theories. A substantial quantitative research tradition has asked what factors come together for a collective action such as a decision or political action to occur or be successful [60,16]. When explaining a protest or strike, political opportunity theories would focus on the nature of the grievances of movement actors, expecting that those with greater grievances would be more likely to take action [55]. Political opportunity theories would also emphasize network relations among movement actors as important factors in joining a social movement [52]. Resource mobilization theories would focus on group resources as important factors in social movement mobilization, as well as the relative isolation of a group from other participating social movement groups [53].", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_18": "For the final model, we split the corpus of the 4500 comments in a 80-20 train/test set. We kept capitalization and punctuation of comments in their original form and removed the quoted content in the case that a user was quoting another user. To train our model, we used the large language model XLnet [129]. XLnet is an architecture that combines transformers and auto-regressive modeling. We selected XLnet over other commonly used language models such as BERT [39] because it still holds the top performance in multiple text classification benchmarks (e.g., first place in Amazon-5, Amazon-2, DBpedia, Yelp-2, AG News, second place in IMDb, Yelp-5) [126]. We applied a warm-up initialization of 0.1, a learning rate of 3e-5, and a maximum sequence length of 100 words. Our final model resulted in a label ranking average precision score of 91%, while all class specific F1 scores were higher than 0.87. To ensure the robustness of our model, we additionally created an evaluation set of 200 comments, in which each class of the dataset appeared at least ten times. On the evaluation set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.72, label ranking average precision score of 0.85, while all class specific F-1 scores were higher than 0.76 ( Figure 2). Given the obtained model accuracy, we then analyzed a total of 155 million comments in our corpus. To understand to what extent the essential components of deliberation, civic discourse, and demagoguery characterize social media discussions, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA is generally used to test hypotheses about plausible model structures [21], and has commonly been used to model different types of data, from survey information to time-series [22]. Until now, the application of CFA in NLP-driven questions has been limited (e.g., [96]), and our study serves as an inspiration for exploiting its capabilities, but also understanding its limits in machine-learning based research. Factor analysis allowed us to mathematically represent the political theories as latent unobserved variables (factors) as described by a set of observed variables (items). The observed variables corresponded to the different rhetoric components as predicted by the language model. We chose CFA rather than exploratory factor analysis (EFA) since we were investigating whether a specific conceptualization of discourse theories empirically characterized social media discussions, and not which general argument structures were best described by our data. With CFA, we could construct structures of variables that complied with the minimal conceptualizations of political theories and by assessing the quality of model-fit, we explored to what extent political theories can describe how users discuss political topics on Reddit. Furthermore, we quantified which arguments were empirically associated with which theories and their corresponding magnitude of importance."}}

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

The massive globalization [123], intercontinental migrations [142], and forced mobilities of the refugees [98,109] have started to question diferent aspects of the modern secular urban planning systems of the West [31]. For the last few decades, the geopolitics of the religious have received a great deal of attention as the cities of diferent parts of the world are observing a rise in religious nationalism, fundamentalism, and communal violence [58]. Hence, in this era of globalization, religiosity is neither a unique 'feature' of the Global South, nor is there a dichotomy between the North and the South. However, since in the Global South, urban religion and the city coexist from the very beginning, scholars like Robert Orsi have suggested looking at the regional scholarly work from the Global South to understand the necessity of dynamic engagement of religion with the city [106].", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Distributing data using a single property creates a histogram, whereas distributing data using two properties creates a 2D scatter plot with the added option to view a 3D histogram. Data that is distributed along three properties creates a 3D scatter plot. Jeffery can use this action to explore the distribution of different properties, for example, by year. The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions. While this dataset is dominated by Western cinema, there seems to be quite a few movies from South Asia as well.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification"}}

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

within which they can be actively engaged and use their spatial reasoning skills for data analysis. However, virtual worlds need to utilize layouts and organizational schemes that are meaningful to the user and beneficial for data analysis. This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display",

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

Data that is distributed along three properties creates a 3D scatter plot. Jeffery can use this action to explore the distribution of different properties, for example, by year. The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions.

Prior implementations of NMN use pre-defined and fixed textual inputs in their module instantiation. This necessitates a large number of modules as they lack the ability to share weights and exploit associations between similar textual contexts (e.g. \u201cdark cube on the left\u201d vs. \u201cblack cube on the left\u201d). In this work, we address these limitations and evaluate the impact of contextual clues in improving the performance of NMN models. First, we address the problem of fixed textual inputs by parameterizing the module arguments. This substantially reduce the number of modules in NMN by up to 75% without any loss in performance. Next we propose a method to contextualize our parameterized model to enhance the module\u2019s capacity in exploiting the visiolinguistic associations. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art NMN model on CLEVR-Ref+ dataset with +8.1% improvement in accuracy on the single-referent test set and +4.3% on the full test set. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextualization provides +11.2% and +1.7% improvements in accuracy over prior NMN models on CLOSURE and NLVR2. We further evaluate the impact of our contextualization by constructing a contrast set for CLEVR-Ref+, which we call CC-Ref+. We significantly outperform the baselines by as much as +10.4% absolute accuracy on CC-Ref+, illustrating the generalization skills of our approach.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_metadata": "Authors: Jing Ma, Wei Gao, Shafiq R.

Each of these modules are specialized to compute basic reasoning tasks and can be assembled to perform complex and compositional reasoning. (Andreas et al., 2016b) used dependency trees (Zhu et al., 2013) to generate the execution layouts. (Andreas et al., 2016a) proposed dynamic NMNs that learns and adapts the structure of the execution layouts to the question. (Johnson et al., 2017b) proposed homogeneous (IEP) and generic neural modules, unlike fixed and hand-crafted neural module, in which the semantics of each neural module is learnt during training. IEP model achieves promising performance on CLEVR dataset. (Liu et al., 2019) proposed IEP-Ref by extending IEP model to CLEVR-Ref+ dataset and outperformed all the prior works. Although, compositional by design, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow and fail to ground novel combinations of known linguistic constructs (Bahdanau et al., 2019).

of the concept of temporal target and 2) deriving a novel mathematical model to predict error rates. The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31]. Users tend to rely more on anticipation (their internal clock) than on reaction when the task becomes more difficult.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

(2) The efect of mark orientation on trend accuracy would be most pronounced when residual bandwidth was large: that is, a small bandwidth would result in similar accuracy for diferent marks, while a large bandwidth would result in large diferences in accuracy across diferent marks. Prior work [7,21] shows that the dispersion of points infuences accuracy in trend and correlation judgments, with very high accuracy when dispersion from the trend is small. Insofar as we anticipated that mark orientation would guide or bias participants in their estimates, we suspected that the impact of this guidance would be less pronounced for stimuli where the dispersion is low and so accuracy is high in any event.", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_7": "While the WK model explains two important variances, it does not explain the offset between stimulus and tapping, which also changes with IOI [27,29].

In other words, the user is asked to move as quickly as possible to hit the target. Fitts introduced the concept of index of difficulty: M T = a + bID s = a+b log 2 (2D s /W s ). Wobbrock et al. [40] analysed Fitts' law to derive a model of error rates with three task requirements mixed in the temporal and spatial domain: target size D s , target width W s , and temporal target distance D t . As this paper does, they predicted error rates, because there was an explicit requirement to maintain a temporal distance to the target D t . Besides, when the spatial requirement W s is relaxed from Fitts' task, targeting becomes more open-loop-like. Gan and Hoffman [9] proposed a model to predict M T when the goal is to hit a large target at distance D s . Hoffman's law originally predicted M T = a + b \u221a D s . With additional assumptions, it can be expressed as the constant ratio between D s and the standard deviation (SD) of end points [12].", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_4": "We performed a repeated measures rANOVA analysis for understanding fve factors: number of outliers, mark shape, outlier distance to the major cluster, outlier location, as well as outlier density. For analyzing the efect of the outlier distance, we computed all stimuli and then quantized them into fve nonuniform groups based on the ratio of cluster centroid distance and the correlation of main cluster. In the supplementary materials we discuss other factors for which we did not have strong or relevant hypotheses. Mark Orientation. In accordance to our hypothesis, mark orientation had a signifcant efect on the accuracy of the estimations for trend orientation (F (3, 210) = 5.06, p < .05) and trend intercept (F (3, 216) = 5.86, p < .001). As shown in Fig. 10, marks pointing towards the direction of the robust trend (Tri-R) created less error with respect to the robust trend. Similarly, marks pointing towards the full OLS line (Tri-O) produced less error with respect to this line, while the other two marks perform similarly. Our results also support the fnding of Correll & Heer [7] that participants downweighted outlying points when making trend estimates. For the following analyses we therefore used the robust trend line as our basis of comparison. Results for estimating intercepts can be found in the supplemental materials. Outlier Distance. Corresponding to our hypothesis, outlying clusters further away from the remaining points were considered less important for trend estimation. With increasing distance of the outlying cluster our participants produced estimations closer to the robust trend line. We observed that the distance had an extremely signifcant efect on the estimation accuracy with respect to the robust trend orientation (F (4, 284) = 27.94, p < .0001) and the intercept (F (4, 293) = 29.03, p < .0001). Fig. 11(a) shows that the absolute orientation error drops rapidly from 9 to 2 when the outlier distance changes from the smallest to the largest values.", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_title": "On Looking at the Vagina through Labella", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_para_1": "There have been eforts to create dyslexia-specifc spell checkers [32,41,44].

However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_metadata": "Authors: Devamardeep Hayatpur, Haijun Xia, Daniel J.

Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_9": "The model provides a novel explanation to differences among input devices in temporal aspects of performance. It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_para_0": "Implementing touch into virtual reality (VR) is not always a straightforward task.

Although this is effective for stimulation of vision and hearing (senses with relatively small sensing organs), it is much more difficult problem to stimulate the surface of the skin, the largest organ on the human body [8]. Recently, alternative approaches to haptic interfaces emerged, including electrical muscle stimulation [34,35].

Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20].

This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements.

There are many existing optical schemes for touch sensing in the literature, including RGB cameras [2,7,25,30], infrared cameras [1] and thermal cameras [39]. However, these approaches still require fixing the cameras in the environment or using wearable cameras [19,47], which are expensive, power consuming and might introduce privacy issues [3,22]. Aside from cameras, work has also been done to exploit a ring with IMU and light proximity sensor to sense touch [15] or track fingertip movements on uninstrumented surfaces [26].

With the growing popularity of smartwatches, combined with their small touchscreen input space, enabling such surface input via wrist-based sensing holds a high potential for impact.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_7": "In order to implement Touch+Finger gestures as new interaction techniques, it is necessary to track the motions of fingers in the air. Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

Marguardt et al. [22] proposed a unification of touch and gestures called the \"continuous interaction space\" on a digital surface. Also, TouchID [23] led to novel and expressive tabletop interaction techniques by identifying which hand and which part of the hand was touching the surface, as well as what posture and what gesture was being enacted with the fiduciarytagged glove. Similarly, Finger-Aware Shortcuts [36] employed finger, hand, and posture identification for keyboards to provide shortcut availability and expressivity. In this system, a key press can have multiple command mappings depending on which fingers and postures were used to press a key. Jackson et. al. [15] also extend multi-touch interfaces by using a combination of multi-touch gestures and 3D movements of the hand(s) above the surface. Furthermore, Kim et al. [18] and Song et al. [27] augmented touch events on mobile devices with finger gestures by using both hands. One hand controls a touch device, while the other hand performs gestures as an additional input. Conversely, Hinckley et. al. [13] explored interaction techniques with one hand for hand-held devices that leverage the combination of touch and motion, suggesting hybrid touch+motion gestures. In addition, Expressy [33], using only one hand, employed the movement of the wrist to add expressiveness to touch-based interactions. Air+Touch [5] focused on in-air gestures performed only with the thumb to enhance touch interaction while the same hand grasped the phone. Also, by using thumb-based touch gestures on capacitive touch sensors in a ring-like device, Ringteraction [9] presented thumb-index touch interaction, which allowed for enhanced input modalities on handheld devices.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_6": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use kinetic feedback for peripheral awareness integration over mechanisms such as screen notifications, sounds, and haptics, because the user can remain attentive to the experience, rather than having to switch their attention to receive feedback via other sensory inputs, which, in turn, could affect the integration experience. This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_3": "To address the limitations of the 2D touch interaction space, researchers have investigated possible alternative interaction space above, around, and on the back of the devices. SideSight [3] provides virtual, multi-touch interactions around the body of a small mobile device, using infrared (IR) proximity sensors. SideSwipe [35] also leverages the unmodified global system for mobile communication (GSM) signal to enable in-air hand gestures above and at the side of a mobile device. Arefin Shimon et. al., [1] explored hand gestures above a smartwatch in order to overcome the limited interaction space of the small screen. More recently, hovering interactions above the screen [12] have been found to allow for richer and more expressive interactions by identifying the user's intention before a touch event occurs.

However, expanding the interaction space beyond the touchscreen may sacrifice some of the benefits of direct-touch interactions (e.g., increased time for selecting a target and better performance in pointing tasks [16]).

However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_6": "Initial work from Correll & Heer [7] suggests that people are able to perform a general sort of \"regression by eye\" with simple Gaussian stimuli and a single class of outliers. However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_9": "There is an extensive body of works on graphical perception tasks in scatterplots. Rensink [20] states that, much as geneticists use model organisms with simple genomes to model more complex behavior, scatterplots can function as \"fruit fies\" for graphical perception research questions in visualization. Scatterplots become especially important when moving beyond atomic tasks such as extraction and comparison of individual values that are common in foundational graphical perception work such as Cleveland & McGill [5] to \"ensemble\" tasks [27] such as the perception of average value and variance. The assessment of a trend is such an ensemble task, potentially requiring viewers to consider every point in the scatterplot in a holistic way, although recent work [14,18] suggests that \"perceptual proxies\" such as point envelopes and ranges likely guide visual statistical judgments in scatterplots rather than explicit calculations.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_5": "To generate scatterplots with varying densities, we fxed a point Set A and then merged it with another point Set B whose number of points and slope could be adjusted. Specifcally, we frst created a Set A with 40 points, slope of \u03b2 = 1 and residual bandwidth of \u03c3 = 0. Here, we only analyzed 4 slopes instead of 8 (positive and negative) for two reasons: i) we had already studied efect of trend slope sign on trend estimation in our previous experiments and had no strong hypotheses around an interaction with cluster density (see Fig. 7) and ii) mixing a positive trend in Set A with a negative trend in Set B can only produce small regions with non-uniform densities. The number of total stimuli was therefore 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 = 96 stimuli plus 4 additional validation stimuli synthesized by Eq. 1 as attention checks for this experiment. Fig. 13 shows six examples generated by merging the green and orange point sets with overlaid green and orange trend lines. Figs. 13(a,b,c) demonstrate that changing the number of points in one set with a fxed slope infuences the perceived density. On the other hand, changing the trend slope while keeping the number of points unchanged infuences the bounding boxes, as shown in Figs. 13(d,e,f). Since bounding boxes are an efcient visual proxy for the perception of the correlations in scatterplots [36], we speculated that the size of the bounding box might also impact the visual estimates of the trends. Note that the colors used in Fig. 13 are for illustrative purposes only, Fig. 14 shows an example stimuli used in the experiment. Mark Orientation. As with the prior experiments, we used static marks (circles and Tri-Up) as well as a set of marks with data-driven orientations. In this case, the triangle marks were rotated towards the orientation of the trend of Set A (Tri-A) or Set B (Tri-B), which serves as the upper or lower bound of the orientation of the user ft. In particular, Tri-A was fxed with 45 \u2022 , while the orientation of Tri-B was a value in the set of {5.7 \u2022 , 11.3 \u2022 , 21.8 \u2022 , 38.7 \u2022 }.", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_para_2": "To distribute the points along one or more axes, the user can use the distribute action ( Figure 6). Distributing data using a single property creates a histogram, whereas distributing data using two properties creates a 2D scatter plot with the added option to view a 3D histogram. Data that is distributed along three properties creates a 3D scatter plot. Jeffery can use this action to explore the distribution of different properties, for example, by year. The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions. While this dataset is dominated by Western cinema, there seems to be quite a few movies from South Asia as well.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_2": "(1) Mark orientation would have a strong efect on trend estimation: an orientation consistent with the trend direction results in a higher accuracy. In other words, we expect mark shapes to guide or bias the estimates of the participants. Prior work indicates that carefully designed mark orientation can direct the perception of cluster structures in scatterplots [3,17]. (2) The efect of mark orientation on trend accuracy would be most pronounced when residual bandwidth was large: that is, a small bandwidth would result in similar accuracy for diferent marks, while a large bandwidth would result in large diferences in accuracy across diferent marks. Prior work [7,21] shows that the dispersion of points infuences accuracy in trend and correlation judgments, with very high accuracy when dispersion from the trend is small. Insofar as we anticipated that mark orientation would guide or bias participants in their estimates, we suspected that the impact of this guidance would be less pronounced for stimuli where the dispersion is low and so accuracy is high in any event.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_11": "The choice of mark shapes in scatterplots is important and has great impact on the discriminability of clusters [16,29] as well as the legibility of other encoding channels such as color [26]. Furthermore, there seems to be a qualitative diference between closed and open shapes [4] for the assessments of similarity and diference within classes [8]. Despite this potential impact, many (or even most) visualizations rely on default mark shapes [2], typically circles. Of particular interest to us is the work by Ziemkiewicz & Kosara on the \"implied dynamics\" [37] of visualizations. Their work on marks in scatterplots specifcally suggests that \"attractor\" points [38] can create a bias for results of graphical perception tasks (even to the extent of irrational decision-making, as pointed out by Dimara et al. [9,10]).", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_7": "However, the bias introduced by data-driven marks is small when the trend line is more certain. This is the case if the residual bandwidth is small, outliers are far away from the major cluster or have diferent densities, or if the intermingled clusters have radically diferent slopes. In such cases there is little ambiguity in the trend, and so estimates are accurate even without guidance from mark orientation. Implications for Scatterplot Design. The above fndings suggest that mark orientation can be a visual cue to implicitly encode trend information. A trend line directly encodes the model in a dogmatic way, whereas data-driven marks act as less dogmatic guidance that can be ignored or downweighted when they seem inappropriate or are clearly at odds with the depicted data, functioning as a form of \"implicit uncertainty visualization\" [6]. We have shown viewers will, in their own visual estimates, ignore things like outliers that would be a problem for explicit trend lines based on models of insufcient complexity. Fig. 19 shows how data-driven marks could be used to disambiguate trends in a health care dataset for investigating how the blood pressure is related to sodium excretion [11]. We can see that the slopes of the OLS trend and the robust trend have opposing signs (see Fig. 19(a)). Using data-driven marks can suggest a resolution to this ambiguity for the reviewer by downweight (b) or reinforcing (c) the contribution of the outlying points to the overall trend. Although it is hard to make a fair comparison between such implicit and explicit trend visualizations (for instance, Correll & Heer [7] believed that participants would adhere to explicit trend lines so closely if present that they used such stimuli as action checks), we believe that data-driven orientation can assist in regression by eye, especially for cases where standard models like OLS are inappropriate, or there are multiple valid interpretations of the data (as in Xiong et al. [34]).", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_1": "We chose synthetic stimuli to be able to compare our work with prior approaches such as [7,12,18,21], which in most cases use synthetic stimuli. A second reason was to have precise control over the features in the scatterplots. This allows us to directly assess our research questions (which primarily dealt with the robustness and feasibility of data-driven marks under specifc conditions). Mark Shape and Orientation. While there exists a vast palette of potential mark shape options for which we would anticipate difering patterns of perceptual judgments [8], we focus on triangles and circles, which are the most widely used marks. For example, over 97% of all single-class scatterplots in the VizNet [13] dataset use one of those two mark types. Besides a default upward oriented orientation, we test triangles rotated using data-driven factors, with circles as a default option without inherent orientation. We also found that most triangle marks in VizNet [13] dataset are equilateral triangles; thus, while isosceles triangles have less ambiguity in their encoding of orientation, we use equilateral triangles. Additionally, unlike isosceles triangles, the exact center of equilateral triangles is easier to estimate, which might have benefts for distributional estimation tasks.", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_0": "We base our experimental methods on those employed by Correll & Heer [7]. The authors created scatterplots based on an initial set of Gaussian residuals of varying bandwidths (corresponding to an increasing level of dispersion) to which a particular trend was added, allowing orthogonal control over the slope of the trend line and the dispersion of the points (c.f. Rensink & Balridge [21] and Harrison et al. [12] in which correlation and slope are entangled). Participants then manipulated a trend line with a slider until they felt that it matched the trend in the data, with the error measured as the diference (both absolute and signed) in the user defned trend and the actual source trend.

Many of our participants reported mentally drawing a bounding box for all points, and then removing outliers. Since the trend is not strictly determined by these perceptual proxies [14,18], we cannot directly compute how these global or local visual structures were used. In the future, we will quantitatively model how the estimated trend is related to these proxies and to model a larger set of mark shapes and sizes. Since participants might have used diferent strategies for dealing with outliers (e.g., considering or discarding) in Experiment 2, the efects of outliers are likely to difer based on the individual strategy . In the future, we will model individual diferences and preform a secondary analysis of the experimental data as did by Kay and Heer [15]. In addition, we are particularly interested in how the mark size (and its infuence on visual artifacts like overplotting and occlusion) could skew assessments of local density and the resulting estimated trend. We are also interested in expanding our study of data-driven orientation to wider use cases, especially under additional \"adversarial\" scatterplot conditions [18] (such as marks with transparency, high degrees of overplotting, nonlinear or non-uniform trends, or where likely perceptual proxies like bounding boxes are uninformative).", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_3": "(1) Mark orientation would afect trend estimation: we believed that a mark orientation consistent with the robust trend line would encourage participants to ignore or otherwise downweight outliers.

Prior work shows that participants downweight (but did not entirely discount) outliers when performing trend estimation [7], although only with very distance outliers. We wanted to explore the placement of outliers in greater detail.

For analyzing the efect of the outlier distance, we computed all stimuli and then quantized them into fve nonuniform groups based on the ratio of cluster centroid distance and the correlation of main cluster. In the supplementary materials we discuss other factors for which we did not have strong or relevant hypotheses. Mark Orientation. In accordance to our hypothesis, mark orientation had a signifcant efect on the accuracy of the estimations for trend orientation (F (3, 210) = 5.06, p < .05) and trend intercept (F (3, 216) = 5.86, p < .001). As shown in Fig. 10, marks pointing towards the direction of the robust trend (Tri-R) created less error with respect to the robust trend. Similarly, marks pointing towards the full OLS line (Tri-O) produced less error with respect to this line, while the other two marks perform similarly. Our results also support the fnding of Correll & Heer [7] that participants downweighted outlying points when making trend estimates. For the following analyses we therefore used the robust trend line as our basis of comparison. Results for estimating intercepts can be found in the supplemental materials. Outlier Distance. Corresponding to our hypothesis, outlying clusters further away from the remaining points were considered less important for trend estimation. With increasing distance of the outlying cluster our participants produced estimations closer to the robust trend line. We observed that the distance had an extremely signifcant efect on the estimation accuracy with respect to the robust trend orientation (F (4, 284) = 27.94, p < .0001) and the intercept (F (4, 293) = 29.03, p < .0001).

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_para_1": "In recent years, advanced visualization authoring systems, such as Lyra [34], iVisDesigner [31], iVoLVER [28], and DDG [21], have been developed to facilitate the creation of data-driven infographics.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction"}}

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015). Recently, neural architectures have been shown effective in such a task, whereby minimal feature engineering is required (Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Peters et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Domain adaptation, as a special case for transfer learning, aims to exploit the abundant data of wellstudied source domains to improve the performance in target domains of interest (Pan and Yang, 2010;Weiss et al., 2016). There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain. The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process. Figure 1 illustrates the two approaches based on the BLSTM-CRF (bidirectional LSTM augmented with a CRF layer) architecture for NER.

However, despite significant resources required for training such models, the performance of a model trained on one domain typically degrades dramatically when applied to a different domain, yet extracting entities from new emerging domains such as social media can be of significant interest. In this paper, we empirically investigate effective methods for conveniently adapting an existing, well-trained neural NER model for a new domain. Unlike existing approaches, we propose lightweight yet effective methods for performing domain adaptation for neural models. Specifically, we introduce adaptation layers on top of existing neural architectures, where no re-training using the source domain data is required.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain. Finally, we also perform a thorough investigation of our system performances, providing insights and pinpointing the reasons behind our improvements via a fine-grained evaluation on different label-frequency classes.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_0": "Being able to associate entity mentions in a given text with the correct entity they refer to is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Similarly to SoPa, several recently introduced variants of CNNs support varying window sizes by either allowing several fixed window sizes (Yin and Sch\u00fctze, 2015) or by supporting non-consecutive n-gram matching (Lei et al., 2015;Nguyen and Grishman, 2016).", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_para_8": "All these existing works do not use domainspecific embeddings for different domains and they use the same neural model for source and target models.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_para_6": "Convolutional neural networks.

Sampling has also been utilized in an abundance of NLP tasks, such as text generation (Clark et al., 2018;Fedus et al., 2018), co-reference resolution (Singh et al., 2012), and language modeling (Mnih and Hinton, 2007;Logan IV et al., 2020).", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_abstract": "Probabilistic distributions over spanning trees in directed graphs are a fundamental model of dependency structure in natural language processing, syntactic dependency trees. In NLP, dependency trees often have an additional root constraint: only one edge may emanate from the root. However, no sampling algorithm has been presented in the literature to account for this additional constraint. In this paper, we adapt two spanning tree sampling algorithms to faithfully sample dependency trees from a graph subject to the root constraint. Wilson (1996(\u2019s sampling algorithm has a running time of O(H) where H is the mean hitting time of the graph. Colbourn (1996)\u2019s sampling algorithm has a running time of O(N\u02c63), which is often greater than the mean hitting time of a directed graph. Additionally, we build upon Colbourn\u2019s algorithm and present a novel extension that can sample K trees without replacement in O(K N\u02c63 + K\u02c62 N) time.

These algorithms come in two flavors. First, random walks through Markov chains have been used to sample spanning trees from both undirected (Broder, 1989;Aldous, 1990) and directed graphs (Wilson, 1996). The algorithm of Wilson (1996) is linear in the mean hitting time of the graph and is currently the fastest sampling algorithm for directed spanning trees. It has been used in dependency parsing inference by Zhang et al. (2014a,b). Second, several algorithms have leveraged the matrix-tree theorem (MTT; Kirchhoff, 1847;Tutte, 1984). The MTT has been frequently used to perform inference on non-projective graphbased dependency parsers (Koo et al., 2007;Mc-Donald and Satta, 2007;Smith and Smith, 2007;Zmigrod et al., 2021). This theorem was first used for sampling by Gu\u00e9noche (1983) who gave an O(N 5 ) algorithm which was then improved by Kulkarni (1990) and Colbourn et al. (1996). Colbourn et al.

In our experiments, we found that if we consider every preceding concept fragment to the left of the current fragment in a right-to-left order in the search process, the decoder suffers from low efficiency and poor performance. Unlike the beam-search for dependency parsing, which can greatly reduce the search space by exploiting the projectivity property of the dependency tree (Covington, 2001;Zhang and Clark, 2008a), this naive search process in this context inevitably leads to huge search space, and furthermore is difficult to guarantee the connectivity of output graph. Instead, we propose a componentwise beam search scheme, which can not only alleviate much noisy partial candidate, but also ensure that the final output graph is connected.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_para_3": "We give a comparison between our approach and other state-of-the-art AMR parsers, including CCGbased parser (Artzi et al., 2015) and dependencybased parser (Wang et al., 2015b).

We use the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) for our English experiments, with standard splits of sections 2-21 for training, section 22 for development, and section 23 for testing. We use the French Treebank from the SPMRL 2014 shared task (Seddah et al., 2014) with its provided splits for our French experiments. No token preprocessing is performed, and only a single <UNK> token is used for unknown words at test time. The inputs to our system are concatenations of 100-dimensional word embeddings and 50-dimensional part-of-speech embeddings. In the case of the French Treebank, we also include 50-dimensional embeddings of each morphological tag. We use automatically predicted tags for training and testing, obtaining predicted part-ofspeech tags for the Penn Treebank using the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) with 10-way jackknifing, and using the provided predicted partof-speech and morphological tags for the French Treebank.

From non-parallel streams of Chinese characters and Chinese pinyin syllables, it establishes a many-to-many mapping between characters and pronunciations. Using unsupervised methods, the program effectively deciphers writing into speech. Its token-level character-to-syllable accuracy is 89%, which significantly exceeds the 22% accuracy of prior work.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_metadata": "Authors: S.

Sequence tagging approaches label words as fluent or disfluent using a variety of different techniques, including conditional random fields (CRF) (Georgila, 2009;Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014), Max-Margin Markov Networks (M 3 N) (Qian and Liu, 2013), Semi-Markov CRF (Ferguson et al., 2015), and recurrent neural networks (Hough and Schlangen, 2015;Zayats et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016). The main benefit of sequential models is the ability to capture longterm relationships between reparandum and repairs. Noisy channel models (Charniak and Johnson, 2001;Johnson and Charniak, 2004;Zwarts et al., 2010;Lou and Johnson, 2017) use the similarity between reparandum and repair as an indicator of disfluency. Parsing-based approaches (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013;Honnibal and Johnson, 2014;Wu et al., 2015;Yoshikawa et al., 2016;Jamshid Lou et al., 2019) jointly perform parsing and disfluency detection. The joint models can capture long-range dependency of disfluencies as well as chunk-level information. However, training a parsing-based model requires large annotated tree-banks that contain both disfluencies and syntactic structures.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_abstract": "Most existing approaches to disfluency detection heavily rely on human-annotated corpora, which is expensive to obtain in practice. There have been several proposals to alleviate this issue with, for instance, self-supervised learning techniques, but they still require human-annotated corpora. In this work, we explore the unsupervised learning paradigm which can potentially work with unlabeled text corpora that are cheaper and easier to obtain. Our model builds upon the recent work on Noisy Student Training, a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the idea of self-training. Experimental results on the commonly used English Switchboard test set show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art supervised systems using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. BERT and ELECTRA).", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_0": "Dataset.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_0": "Peer production is a powerful example of the potential of social computing in which communities like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM)-the 'Wikipedia of Maps' [32,73]create high-quality content at previously unimaginable scales.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience)."}}

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_4": "The most teachable moment for software tasks is often when the user is actively working... but stuck. In-task help for a specific goal is one of the biggest reasons people seek web [27] and video [4] tutorials. However, tutorials tend to show a full task from start to finish, much of which may not be relevant to the user's current goal. This leaves it to the user to both find a relevant tutorial and locate the segment(s) within it that contains the needed information. Effectively searching the Web is an acquired skill; coming up with the right keywords and search settings can be difficult, especially for novices [44]. In addition, web search environments lack context that human tutors use to proactively offer help and tailor feedback [45]. Adding contextual terms automatically to search queries (e.g., os version, application, recently-used tools) can help improve the relevance and utility of search results without requiring the user to know app-specific terminology [7,13,33]. RePlay augments queries with the current application name and uses context from both the current and recently-used applications to support cross-app activities when ranking search results.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_1": "Web search results can of course include communitycreated resources that span applications. However, generic web search poses two problems. First, search is blind to relevant contextual information that could connect users to better resources [13,14,26]. Search engines place the burden on users to articulate an appropriate query, an almost paradoxical requirement for users who are there because they don't know the domain [44]. Second, search is divorced from the application UX, requiring users to bounce back and forth to connect the content [15]. These challenges are amplified when users work with multiple applications, each with its own terminology and conventions.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_5": "level of deliberation.

Over the last decade, IVR platforms for underserved communities seem to have settled on several de facto standards of interface design. These include airtime subsidies, social features, and advertisements to attract and retain users. Prior work shows that lack of airtime subsidy leads to low call volume and engagement [51,62], which causes IVR services to struggle with long-term sustainability [63]. Successful IVR forums have also engaged and retained users through social features (e.g. voting and comments) [49,62], spreading mechanisms such as the ability to forward content to friends [49,50], incentivized referrals [61], and advertisements [41]. Contrary to these prevailing norms, we designed and deployed Karamad without subsidies, social features, spreading mechanisms, or advertisements. Our work advances the existing HCI literature on IVR services for underserved populations by showing that in the absence of such features, paid crowd work can similarly achieve trust, engagement, spread, retention, and self-training.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_12": "In this work, we focused specifically on people with visual impairments, for which touch interaction pose many challenges, because touchscreens rely almost exclusively on visual input [22,23,54]. However, we formalized our method in a way that is independent of the characteristics of the target population so that it would be easy to apply for synthesizing gesture sets for other user populations as well. For example, touch input remains largely inaccessible to people with motor impairments who need to adopt workaround strategies to be able to access content on touchscreen devices [4,37] and who need specific touch interaction techniques [40]. We also know from the literature of touch interaction for children that small children between 3 and 6 years old experience difficulties with touch and multitouch input [67] and that the touch gestures of children between 7 and 10 years old are recognized with lower accuracy rates than the same gestures produced by adults [3]. Because our method is able to transfer the articulation characteristics of gestures produced by a few users to a particular user population, we believe that addressing other user groups, such as those mentioned above, is viable and we leave these interesting exploration opportunities for future work.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_para_7": "Three different questionnaires were applied for evaluating perceived usability: two short questionnaires during the breaks (six statements each, total 12 statements) and a summative questionnaire at the end of each user scenario (10 statements).

Studies of human sentence processing have shown comparable susceptibility to interference from irrelevant context elements, depending on semantic and syntactic properties ( Van Dyke, 2007;Parker and Phillips, 2017;Dillon et al., 2013). Systematic comparison of interference effects in humans and in language models stands to shed light on mechanistic similarities and differences in the ways that these language processing systems handle information from prior context."}}

Many open questions remain regarding the sociolinguistic underpinnings of written code-switching, and progress has been limited by a lack of suitable resources. We introduce a novel, large, and diverse dataset of written code-switched productions, curated from topical threads of multiple bilingual communities on the Reddit discussion platform, and explore questions that were mainly addressed in the context of spoken language thus far. We investigate whether findings in oral code-switching concerning content and style, as well as speaker proficiency, are carried over into written code-switching in discussion forums. The released dataset can further facilitate a range of research and practical activities.", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_para_1": "Many studies have elucidated the communicative functions of oral code-switching.

The basic idea is to map dependency arcs from a source treebank to its target translation according to word alignments. This method, however, can suffer from imperfect alignment between source and target words. To address this problem, we investigate syntactic transfer by code mixing, translating only confident words in a source treebank. Cross-lingual word embeddings are leveraged for transferring syntactic knowledge to the target from the resulting code-mixed treebank. Experiments on University Dependency Treebanks show that code-mixed treebanks are more effective than translated treebanks, giving highly competitive performances among cross-lingual parsing methods.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Careful consideration should be given to balance the advantages of coding with the disadvantages of adding technology to outdoor play [31].", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_para_6": "Children's ability to program the device and use it as an integral part of their outdoor play experiences is not trivial. The essence of outdoor play is \"heads up\" social interaction and physical activity [11,16,31,43], which are not natural characteristics of coding activities. Moreover, adding screens to outdoor play (a coding platform running on a tablet device) is thought to interfere with natural play patterns [34] and compromise the benefits of natural play [44]. Nonetheless, the children successfully bridged this gap, using the \"heads down\" coding activity to create code that generates a \"heads up\" outdoor game experience. In addition, children played their games with their friends with no further adjustments to the code, indicating that they were able to program playable outdoor games. This may be attributed to the clear distinction between the coding platform and the digital device, that framed the coding platform as a tool for defining the game and the device as a tool for playing the game. Future work should test this assumption and compare the digital coding platform to a more tangible coding platform. While physical programming may preserve the \"heads up\" nature of outdoor play, it may also be perceived as part of the game instead of a mechanism for defining the game rules.", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_metadata": "Authors: Netta Ofer, Idan David, H.

Coding, a typically indoor, screen-based activity, can potentially enrich outdoor play, serving as a rule-making medium. We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device, enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas, coding them, and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study, 24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones, enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements, integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code, and were excited to see their code come to life. We conclude children can use coding to express their ideas by creating technologically-enhanced outdoor play experiences.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_para_2": "Experience with coding from a young age is thought to extend children's ability to design, create, and invent [37,40,41].

As coding becomes common in many schools, a wide range of approaches should be developed for introducing coding to diverse audiences. Outdoor play adds a unique nature to coding, and may appeal to children in ways that traditional coding activities do not, especially to children who are \"outdoor play-fluent\" [19].", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_metadata": "Authors: Nikhila Nyapathy, R.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

The pricing of rewards for tasks we requested on Karamad were set generously for several reasons. First, we wanted to ensure that our workers were not losing money due to airtime costs, particularly if users made mistakes while learning to use the system. Our workers being very poor have low tolerance to risk. Second, we wanted to ensure that they were paid at least minimum wage [59]. Third, we wanted to pay at a comparable market rate per task relative to existing tasks on MTurk [24]. Given the minimum wage in Pakistan for unskilled labor is set to PKR 15,000 per month, for 8 hours a day, and 26 days a month, the per-hour wage is roughly PKR 72 (0.43 USD) per hour. Based on these considerations, we paid roughly PKR 1,400 (8.43 USD) per hour, which is 20x federal minimum wage in Pakistan. This is a modest sum even in the context of Pakistan because the minimum wage is very low. To put this in perspective, the cost of the smallest monthly internet package for Ufone, a local mobile network provider, is 390 rupees or approximately 5 times the minimum wage. In absolute terms, workers spent on average 81 minutes using Karamad in total during the course of our deployment. Our pricing is also roughly in line with recent closely related IVR-based pilot studies conducted in India (we paid approximately $0.042 per question and approximately $8.43 per hour after accounting for airtime costs compared to $0.046 per question for Learn2Earn [61] and $9.81 per hour in the case of ReCall [63])."}}

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

emotions in conversations. This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_para_5": "FewRel (Han et al., 2018;Gao et al., 2019) is a common benchmark for few-shot learning in NLP, which consists of many few-shot relation classification tasks created by sub-sampling from a pool of relation labels.

More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%.

Visual referring expression recognition (REF) is the task of identifying the object in an image that is referred to by a natural language expression (Mao et al., 2016;Kazemzadeh et al., 2014). Datasets containing real images and expressions such as RefCOCO+ (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014) and Ref-COCOg (Mao et al., 2016) have been proposed to evaluate the progress on this task. Multi-modal transformers (Lu et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019;Tan and Bansal, 2019), using pretrain-then-transfer approach, have shown superior performance on these datasets. However, these models fail to learn robust visio-linguistic contextual representations and are shown to exploit the imbalanced distribution in the train and test splits (Akula et al., 2020a;Cirik et al., 2018). Recently, CLEVR-Ref+ (Liu et al., 2019) has been introduced as a synthetic diagnostic benchmark that allows control over dataset bias. There are nearly 0.8M referring expressions of which 32% of expressions refer to only a single object (Single-referent) and 68% refer to more than one object (Multi-referent). In this paper, we refer to the full dataset as F-Ref and the single-referent subset as S-Ref.

The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design.

Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates.

Most importantly, they induce modulation of neural activity in broad areas of the cortex, which could make them particularly suitable for use with consumer-grade EEG equipment with few sensors. We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4].

Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording, and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires at home.

The second reason for emergence of the illusory touch is the way how the human brain constructs bodily representation. Information from the senses are integrated in the brain to form plausible (internally consistent) representation of own body [24]. It has been revealed that the multisensory integration process can be manipulated to create altered perception of the self. One of the earliest experiments demonstrating malleability of the bodily representation is known as the rubber hand illusion [6]. In the rubber hand illusion, simultaneous haptic stimulation of a participant's hand (hidden behind a screen) and a rubber hand placed ahead of the participant (in a natural resting position) leads to rising of feelings that the rubber hand is actually part of the participant's body, and the tactile sensations seem to be originating in the rubber hand.", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_6": "Concerning the usability of the system, we first analyzed the time that subjects required to fit the headset at the beginning of every recording session.

Tactile perception is largely dependent on the integration of information from multiple senses. This is in line with the study discovering that observing a video with a hand being touched during the reception of tactile stimuli on own hand enhances the sensory threshold [53]. Moreover, just observing touch on other human body can be 'felt'. In [28], it was found that touch observation activates the somatosensory areas in the brain. Indeed, humans posses such 'tactile empathy' that allows them to experience illusory tactile sensations while seeing other persons being touched.

Changes to the field of view in peripheral awareness have been linked with quality of human performance. This instinctive narrowing of vision that occurs as a threat is perceived has implications in activities that benefit from the user having a wide field of view, such as cycling to navigate the environment. We present \"Ena\", a novel EEG-eBike system that draws from the user's neural activity to determine when the user is in a state of peripheral awareness to regulate engine support. A study with 20 participants revealed various themes and tactics suggesting that peripheral awareness as a neurological state is viable to align human-machine integration with internal bodily processes. Ena suggests that our work facilitates a safe and enjoyable human-computer integration experience.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_6": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use kinetic feedback for peripheral awareness integration over mechanisms such as screen notifications, sounds, and haptics, because the user can remain attentive to the experience, rather than having to switch their attention to receive feedback via other sensory inputs, which, in turn, could affect the integration experience. This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_metadata": "Authors: Josh Andr\u00e9s, M.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_title": "On Looking at the Vagina through Labella", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_2": "Interestingly, maintaining a high signal quality, i.e., a low signal variance, after self-supervised fitting did not necessarily lead to high task performance in this study. On the other hand, we found a high variation of daily accuracies within subjects. The consumer-grade EEG and our fitting algorithm allowed subjects to record neural data quickly, but the hardware may also pose new challenges for the BCI user: Even when perfectly fitted, the dry sensors at distant ends of the scalp may require users to induce strong, consistent modulations in neural activity in order to be reliably detected. As one potential mediator, meditation experience may affect the ability to maintain focus in unsupervised environments [27]. However, in a post-hoc analysis, we found that self-reported meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies in this study. On the other hand, daily motivational scores correlate positively with accuracy in this study. Therefore, using the MYND platform to combine easily accessible control strategies with motivating, daily feedback could further improve performance and help with more consistent execution. This feedback will need to be robust to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and higher susceptibility to involuntary head-muscle artifacts around the ears and the forehead, where the sensors are located. As one promising approach to implement robust feedback, concurrent work in [28] explored an adaptive signal-filtering method that relies on signal-variation, similar to the fitting algorithm presented here. Providing immediately accessible daily decoding scores could be implemented on the device by utilizing prior information from higher quality laboratory data via transfer-learning, as shown in this offline analysis.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_0": "The popularity of stroke gesture input for graphical user interfaces has vastly increased with the prevalence of touchscreen devices. Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_metadata": "Authors: M.

Similarly, the \"Music imagery\" strategy instructs subjects to switch between playing their favorite song in their head or consecutively subtract a small number from a larger number, which has also been found to modulate parietal alpha-activity [33], [4].

These vectors are normally learned such that they are predictive of some word co-occurrence statistic, but they are otherwise unconstrained. However, the words from a given language can be organized in various natural groupings, such as syntactic word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs) and semantic themes (e.g. sports, politics, sentiment). Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors. We show that this results in word vectors which are qualitatively different from those obtained with existing word embedding models. We furthermore show that our embedding model can also be used to learn high-quality document representations.", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_metadata": "Authors: Pushkar Shukla, Carlos E.

We have evaluated our document embeddings on four standard document classification benchmarks: 1) 20 Newsgroups (20NG) 5 , 2) OHSUMED-23 (OHS) 6 , 3) TechTC-300 (TechTC) 7 , and 4) Reuters-21578 (Reu) 8 .

In the case of the word embedding models, we create document vectors in the same way as we do for our model, by simply replacing the role of target word vectors with document word vectors. In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations. We tuned the dimensionality of the embedding from the pool {100, 150, 200} and the number of vMF mixture components from the pool {200, 500, 800}.", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_metadata": "Authors: Yunli Wang, Yu Wu, Lili Mou, Zhoujun Li, Wen-Han Chao | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_para_4": "These findings also have implications for studying mechanistic connections between pre-trained language models and language processing in humans.

For example, in (Das et al., 2015) it was proposed to replace the usual representation of topics as multinomial distributions over words by Gaussian distributions over a pre-trained word embedding, while (Batmanghelich et al., 2016) and (Li et al., 2016b) used von Mises-Fisher distributions for this purpose. Note that documents are still modelled as multinomial distributions of topics in these models. In (He et al., 2017) the opposite approach is taken: documents and topics are represented as vectors, with the aim of modelling topic correlations in an efficient way, while each topic is represented as a multinomial distribution over words. In this paper, we take a different approach for learning document vectors, by not considering any documentspecific topic distribution. This allows us to represent document vectors and (context) word vectors in the same space and, as we will see, leads to improved empirical results.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_metadata": "Authors: Adithya Pratapa, Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Kavya Nerella | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_metadata": "Authors: Ella Rabinovich, Masih Sultani, S.

We show that the type of smartphone-based activity and the interactional context afect the way in which a particular instance of smartphone use is designed and oriented to by other participants. Instead of treating co-present others as victims of phubbing [1,2,7,87], we describe how the character of one's individual smartphone use is negotiated and collaboratively achieved by all co-present participants. Uncovering these nuances adds to the existing HCI research, which uses video data to describe systematic aspects of smartphone use in natural contexts [8-10, 49, 57, 74, 75]. By analyzing naturally occurring interactions, this study seeks to identify issues with existing defnitions of phubbing and ofers a new conceptualization for future research. As this study also investigates participants' practices of returning smartphone users back into conversations, we conclude the paper with design implications, aiming to support participants' practices for dealing with extended smartphone use.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_metadata": "Authors: B.

Recent studies have shown that mobile technology use is embedded in various everyday activities [8,49,74,79]. Consequently, researchers have raised concerns about the negative efects of pervasive smartphone use on the quality of face-to-face interactions [2,20,80], hence the term phubbing (phone snubbing), which refers to situations when co-present others are overshadowed by smartphone use. So far, most of the existing studies on smartphone use have been based on surveys, interviews, or data collected in experimental settings. One problem with these approaches is that they often fail to take the interactional context of smartphone use into account. The generalizability of much-published research on this issue is also problematic, as the mainstream approaches do not consider when, how, and by whom smartphone use is initiated (i.e., its communicational motivation) and how co-present others then react to this. The necessity to analyze smartphone use in real-life contexts has been recently emphasized [15,37], but relatively few studies have focused on smartphone use in natural communication settings [21,53,71].", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_metadata": "Authors: Alexander J.

However, most of these studies are quantitative in nature and fail to grasp the interactional context of smartphone use. Drawing on video recordings and utilizing multimodal interaction analysis, the present study examines phubbing in naturally occurring interactions among young adults. Contrary to most previous research, the analysis reveals that disengagement often precedes self-initiated smartphone use rather than follows it. The study identifies factors that affect whether phubbing is reciprocated and whether it is oriented to as problematic. As a result of the analysis, an alternative conceptualization of phubbing is offered. By reflecting on participants\u2019 ways of managing phubbing and its consequences, we discuss design solutions for supporting them in this task.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_3": "The concept of phubbing is now widely used in studies aiming to understand how smartphone use afects face-to-face interactions [2,12,13,65,66,87]. Phubbing has been studied in a variety of different settings and types of relationships: professional settings [7], family interactions [7,42], and interactions with romantic partners [7,24,34,56], with friends and acquaintances [2], and even with virtual agents [68]. Despite the diferences in context, phubbing is defned quite similarly in these studies and usually consists of two parts: (1) ignoring co-present other(s) and (2) focusing on the mobile device instead. Prior studies have reported that smartphone-based multitasking (e.g., texting during face-to-face interactions) leads to lower romantic intimacy with partners [6], lower conversation intimacy [59,76,87], a decrease in the level of perceived quality of relationships [34,56], and a lower level of perceived interaction quality [13,86]. Phubbing is also associated with individuals experiencing a sense of social exclusion [17]. In light of the growing number of studies on this topic, several literature reviews have been conducted to summarize fndings about various phubbing practices and their predictors and impacts [5,11]. While some researchers claim that phubbing has become a social norm [12], other scholars argue that it has not yet become a normative practice despite being widespread [2]. It is also paradoxical that survey participants often admit to using technology in interactions with others, while also claiming that such behavior is ofensive and negatively impacts interpersonal interactions [2,7]. In part, these discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that most phubbing research uses quantitative methods, and the most frequent data collection instrument is a questionnaire [11], which often disregards the interactional context of device use. More recent studies underline the importance of studying phubbing in the context of participants' daily environments. It has been shown that phubbing behavior can be assessed diferently by the phubbee (the person receiving phubbing) depending on the context: phubbing does not damage relationships on its own, but the negative impact of phubbing is attributed to negative appraisals, which can vary across diferent situations [24]. There are, however, relatively few studies that analyze actual instances of solitary smartphone use in naturally occurring interactions [52,70]. In this study, we therefore attempt to understand phubbing as it unfolds in real-life situations. However, phubbing must frst be deconstructed and reinterpreted through the lens of interaction analysis, which is done in the next subsection.", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_metadata": "Authors: Kiel S.

Most existing studies in this area use quantitative methods that do not take interactional context into account [11], and it has been recently suggested that smartphone use should be analyzed in the context of participants' daily environments [24,52,87]. While prior HCI studies have elucidated many important aspects of collaborative smartphone use [8-10, 74, 75], self-initiated individual smartphone use has received much less attention. This study contributes to the body of HCI literature by uncovering and describing common patterns of individual smartphone use in everyday co-present interactions. Our fndings demonstrate when and how young adults themselves initiate, carry out, and terminate individual smartphone use when interacting with others. Below, we summarize the key fndings, situate them within previous research and present implications for HCI. We discuss the role of context in the way smartphone use is initiated, factors afecting whether smartphone use is carried out as a temporarily prioritized or as a parallel activity, reasons for reciprocating one's smartphone use and participants' strategies for managing extended smartphone use. The analysis of naturally occurring interactions also allows us to respecify phubbing and suggest guidelines for further research. Drawing on participants' practices of managing extended smartphone use, we propose how the design of mobile technologies can better facilitate social interactions. Finally, we discuss limitations of this study and directions for future research.", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_metadata": "Authors: J.

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis. We adopt a sensor fusion approach by taking both 'surface waves' (i.e., vibrations through surface) and 'sound waves' (i.e., vibrations through air) into analysis to improve sensing resolution. We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_8": "Many passive acoustic approaches have been employed to detect gestures [12,20,21,52] and localize signals [17,24,36,37,48,49].

However, these approaches still require fixing the cameras in the environment or using wearable cameras [19,47], which are expensive, power consuming and might introduce privacy issues [3,22]. Aside from cameras, work has also been done to exploit a ring with IMU and light proximity sensor to sense touch [15] or track fingertip movements on uninstrumented surfaces [26].

For localizing the acoustic signal, the most prevalent approach, which we also use in this work, is time difference of arrival (TDOA) analysis [10,24,36,37,48,49]. For example, PingPongPlus [24] instruments four contact microphones located at the outermost corners of the desired interactive region. When a Ping-Pong ball falls inside of this region, the signal arrives to the four sensors at different times, enabling a hyperbolic intersection localization. Likewise, SurfaceVibe [36] also uses four geophones in a similar setup to enable two interaction types, tap and swipe, on multiple types of surfaces. Instead of instrumenting the surfaces, Toffee [48] augments the mobile devices and laptops with four piezo sensors and demonstrates accurate resolution of the bearings of touch events around the devices, although the evaluation considers only a single user. Besides TDOA analysis, SoundCraft [17] instead uses a target signal subspace method, by adopting the basic idea of Multiple Signal Classification technique, which can localize acoustic signals even in noisy environment.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_metadata": "Authors: Jun Gong, Aakar Gupta, Hrvoje Benko | Venue: ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_metadata": "Authors: Devamardeep Hayatpur, Haijun Xia, Daniel J.

Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20]. Nonetheless, our techniques require wearing multiple rings to track the motions of secondary fingers, which may be somewhat impractical for some users. This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements. For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_para_1": "Some eyes-free input methods for smartwatches have been proposed [15,3,4,16]. Among them, the most similar to B2B-Swipe were developed by G\u00e1bor and Fiener [4], who proposed an input method using a bezel as a tactile landmark for interaction that allows the user to perform eyes-free input. Similarly, B2B-Swipe uses the bezels of a rectangular smartwatch as tactile landmarks so that the user can specify the start bezel without looking at the smartwatch. Some work has used sensors other than the touch screen to realize eyes-free input methods. For example, WatchIt [16] embedded touch sensors within a watchband and allowed the user to perform swiping and tapping on the band; Pasquero et al. [15] used Hall-effect sensors and a force sensor that enable the user to perform various eyes-free gestures, including covering the watch's face and turning the watch's bezel. In contrast, B2B-Swipe uses only a single-touch screen.", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_8": "To track the motion of secondary fingers in the air, the ring-like device prototypes were worn on the thumb and the index finger. We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_metadata": "Authors: Maitraye Das, Brent J.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_metadata": "Authors: Yuki Kubo, B.

Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties.

One study has even explored how certain forms of graphical interaction may support science education goals by helping users learn to improve their ability to evaluate uncertainty in other contexts [53]. Research in the feld of risk communication has argued for almost two decades that providing users with information about the degree and source of uncertainty in forecast models improves their trust in information sources and supports decision-making [88]. Yet more work remains to be done to develop approaches to doing so that inform rather than confuse users. "}}

While the forms of infographics greatly diverge, we focus on one of the most common categories, variations of common data visualizations with visual embellishments. Traditionally, visual embellishments are considered harmful [38]. Visualizations are usually kept plain for the effectiveness of data analysis. Recently, researchers have started to reveal the value of visual embellishments in data communication. For example, Bateman et al. [1] find the recall of embellished charts is significantly higher than plain charts. Haroz et al. [15] learn that ISOTYPE charts are equal to plain charts in terms of reading speed and accuracy, and the added visual information makes them more memorable. Others [5,6,7,35,36] also conclude that appropriate embellishments, such as color and the inclusion of recognizable objects, can increase memorability of visualizations. Besides, Byrne et al. find that figurative elements can effectively provide context, show content, and label data [9].

First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties. Thus, there is much opportunity for HCI and information visualization research to continue studying efective methods for uncertainty visualization approaches for hurricane forecasts [20] [105] [109] [113] [133].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_0": "Peer production is a powerful example of the potential of social computing in which communities like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM)-the 'Wikipedia of Maps' [32,73]create high-quality content at previously unimaginable scales.

In addition, ofcial information created and disseminated by hurricane experts at NOAA or local emergency management ofces is increasingly competing for the public's attention with other sources of information including mainstream and social media and information received from neighbors, friends, and family-members. Another challenge is that many contextual factors, including prior experience with storms, socioeconomic status, and behaviors of an individual's social networks, infuence people's decisions to prepare, evacuate, or take other protective actions prior to storms [15] [32].

The assessment of a trend is such an ensemble task, potentially requiring viewers to consider every point in the scatterplot in a holistic way, although recent work [14,18] suggests that \"perceptual proxies\" such as point envelopes and ranges likely guide visual statistical judgments in scatterplots rather than explicit calculations."}}

At the same time, we aimed through digital technologies to make the bowl unfamiliar, challenging expectations and assumed roles, however in such a way as not to overshadow its familiarity. This approach to defamiliarizing was with the intention of making it simultaneously familiar and strange, and therefore best open to reflection and analysis of the particularities of non-normative perceptions of humantechnology relations and qualities of experience. To support these aims and in keeping with a counterfactual artifact [41] and research product [23], we crafted the Tilting Bowl with a great deal of purpose and quality so it would fit with and be robust enough for everyday settings over time. Additionally, we drew on ideas of unawareness [22], and unselfconscious interaction [38] to guide the design in which the artifact required no human attention nor user interface to function, and the Tilting Bowl suggested more incremental engagements or intersections rather than explicit interaction. Furthermore, it could easily become a part of ad hoc and changing configurations in a home with other objects in what is referred to as ensembles [22,38]. In these respects, the Tilting Bowl was designed specifically to inquire through lived-with experience into the types and qualities of relationships beyond use and functionality that may emerge.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_para_0": "In addition to our material speculation approach, we recruited trained philosophers who have the competencies (e.g. critical thinking, ethical training, philosophical vocabulary, etc.) to help us speculate, reveal, and describe human-technology relations with the Tilting Bowl.

Co-speculation is the recruiting and participation of study participants who are well positioned to actively and knowingly speculate with us in our inquiry in ways that we cannot alone.

Human bodies accumulate toxic waste and after we die, our \"return\" to nature can thus be harmful. To combat this, a mushroom suit is said to decompose one's body safely by removing or neutralizing toxicity. 9 Hence, the conversation combines the topics of self-identity and climate change. For feasibility, the character \"Flo\" in the conversation below represents a set of 3D printed fowers ( Figure 5), which are added to smart speakers. They are analogous to the Alias technology, which is a 3D printable \"parasite\" (depicted in Figure 6) that can be added on top of a smart speaker to create a \"hacked\" CUI, This can stop smart speakers from listening in on conversations when they are not in use. In addition, Alias can help people to rename their smart speakers without losing their functionality, allowing users to utter custom \"wake words\" or sounds instead of default names, such as \"Hey, Alexa\". For our exploration, we imagine that 3D-printable and customizable fowers would be added to smart speakers; these fowers can talk to present-day people about how and why they grow from human bodies. As discussed above, design fction and speculative design are approaches that could help to shape how interactions with CUIs can be designed. A fctional conversation for this exploration is below (as written by the frst author): We explored a diferent use case for CUIs, as a starting point to challenge our habits. As Refowering Self suggests, we can trigger people's critical refection towards behavioral change by directly involving one's present and future selves. Flo is foremost sharing \"our\" side of the story in its version of the future, i.e., 'sharing advice' [70], rather than directly preaching to a person about what to do. Its repeated use of \"us\", \"our\", \"we\", i.e., as frstperson plural pronouns, takes on a tone of solidarity between our present and future selves, as a message on how \"we are in the together\". The emphasis, again, is in juxtaposing diferent temporal dimensions as an experience that CUIs can foster, which is what prior research has not looked into.

However, very recent empirical studies show that some self-attention heads make little contribution and can be pruned as redundant heads. This work takes a novel perspective of identifying and then vitalizing redundant heads. We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads. Experimental results on widely adopted WMT14 and WMT16 English to German and English to Czech language machine translation validate the RHE effectiveness.", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_metadata": "Authors: Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Zhihao Fan, Zengfeng Huang, Weijian Sun, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_metadata": "Authors: E.

At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_metadata": "Authors: Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2018 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_metadata": "Authors: Prafulla Kumar Choubey, A.

(Voita et al., 2019) shows that redundant heads are mostly distributed in the lower encoder layers, meanwhile (Hao et al., 2019; shows that the bottom layer in the encoder, which directly takes word embedding as input, benefits more from modeling local relations. We evaluate the performance of applying our method on the low-and high-level encoder layers in the next section, and obtain the best performance when applying on the first encoder layer.  (Collins et al., 2005). The byte-pair encoding (BPE) toolkit 2 (Sennrich et al., 2016) is used with 32K merge operations. The 4-gram NIST BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) is used as the evaluation metric. We implement the proposed RHE and all the baselines on top of Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by using open-source toolkit OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017). Please refer to the Appendix for more details of dataset and parameter setting . Table 1 shows the ablation study results of the Transformer enabled by the two proposed SEA mechanisms DEA and LPEA and the RHE approach. First, the Rows of \"+DEA\" and \"+LPE\" represent the models with all heads of the first encoder layer, including original important heads, are replaced by the syntax-enhanced attention networks DEA and LPEA respectively. Second, the RHE approach (containing the Rows of \"+DEA+RHE\" and \"+LPEA+RHE\" ) significantly lifts both DEA and LPEA mechanisms across all small and large language pairs. This tests the effectiveness of identifying and modifying redundant heads without interfering important head functions. RHE lifts the LPEA, which together i.e. LPEA+RHE substantially outperforms Transformer by +1.0 BLEU points on En\u2192De (WMT16), +0.96 BLEU points on En\u2192De (WMT14), and +0.81 BLEU points on En\u2192Cs (WMT16).

Our model, which is based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) text generation model, is fine-tuned simultaneously for both reranking (in order to improve the precision of the top retrieved passages) and extracting the answer. Unlike previous work, monoQA makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task, followed by the other tokens for the answer extraction task, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Our contributions are summarised as follows: (1) we leverage Multi-Task Learning with a text generation model by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure to effectively addresses the ORConvQA task; (2) using two different ORConvQA datasets, we compare our model to two strong baselines from the literature, and show that our MTL reranker and generative reader approach yields the best F1, Recall, MRR, Figure 2: An example dialog and relevant passages from the ORConvQA dataset (Qu et al., 2020). and MAP performance improvements over the strongest baseline with statistically significant improvements ranging from +5.70% to +23.34%; (3) the proposed MTL model combining the reranker and generative reader significantly outperforms and is twice as fast for inference than the individual application of the monoT5 and UnifiedQA models for reranking and extracting the answer.", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_3": "On the other hand, Nogueira et al.

However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has combined monoT5 and UnifiedQA by sharing a single text generation model, in order to directly extract the answers instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever.

Conversational Question Answering: This is a conversational search task, where the system needs to correctly interpret a question in the context of an ongoing conversation. Most research on conversational QA focuses on conversational response ranking tasks (Dalton et al., 2019(Dalton et al., , 2020(Dalton et al., , 2021 and extractive QA tasks (Choi et al., 2018;Reddy et al., 2019;Qu et al., 2019b;Yeh and Chen, 2019). Qu et al. (2020) were first to define the task of Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (OR-ConvQA), where the system is required to learn to retrieve top relevant passages from a large collection before extracting answers from the passages. To address the ORConvQA task, Qu et al. (2020) proposed a three-stage pipeline: (1) a retriever, (2) a reranker, and (3) a reader. Later, Qu et al. (2021) introduced a learned weakly-supervised training approach to address the problem of accessing gold passages during the training of the model on the OR-CoQA dataset in (Qu et al., 2020). One particular problem is coarse ranking, where the reranker of Qu et al. (2020) only takes the top-ranked passages as input. This makes the whole pipeline suffers from this coarse ranking, especially for situations when the golden passages are not retrieved in the top-ranked passages. Liang et al. (2022) addressed this issue by adding a post-ranker module that can push more relevant passages to the reader. However, these works typically approach reranking and reading as classification tasks to find an answer span for retrieved passages (start/end positions). Instead, we use a text generation model with multi-task learning for both the reranker and reader in order to directly extract the answers for the users instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_11": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Conversational QA: MTL methods have recently been effectively implemented in existing Conversational QA works (Kongyoung et al., 2020;Qu et al., 2019b;Xu et al., 2019;Yeh and Chen, 2019;Qu et al., 2020Qu et al., , 2021. However, all of the tasks in these works leverage MTL by sharing the network structure between an extractive reader and its auxiliary tasks, which are typically classification tasks, such as a yes/no question prediction or a follow-up question prediction. For example, some existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021 have applied MTL on reranking and answer reading by adding two fully-connected layers (one for the reranker and reader, respectively) to find an answer span for the retrieved passages (start/end positions).

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_12": "Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has increasingly become a popular approach for tackling several tasks in a uniform model .

We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation.

Extractive reader models (Qu et al., 2019a,b;Yeh and Chen, 2019) are typically employed, where the goal is to classify the start and end positions of the answer span in the given passage. In contrast, generative readers (Raffel et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020; have demonstrated impressive results on the extractive QA tasks, where the goal is to generate tokens that are a subset of a passage.

Instead, criminals keep some commitments to the dominant values of society and use some techniques to conciliate them with their criminal acts. Sykes and Matza identifed fve such techniques: denying the responsibility, denying the negativity of the efects, turning the victim or the condemners into culprits, or appealing to higher values [53]. Their ideas have been extensively used in the study of criminal behavior, included within various theoretical frameworks [33], and re-elaborated by Scott and Lyman's theory of accounts [49]. They have also been applied to the study of cybercrime, and evidence of recourse to all fve types of neutralization techniques has been found so far in research on hackers [24]. When it comes to understanding lay citizens' participation in cyberattacks, which is the topic of this paper, Sykes and Mazda's theory suggests that the distinction between a community of criminals and the community of law-abiding citizens is culturally more blurred than one might assume. One does not need to give up all values of the dominant society to legitimize their illegal behaviors. Indeed, Chua et al [9] as well as Morris et al [38] surveyed college students and found such neutralization techniques. Morris et al., in particular, investigated common forms of computer hacking, such as accessing somebody else's device or guessing somebody else's password [38].", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_2": "The clearest theorization of attitudes as positions in an argumentative space is due to the discursive psychologist Michael Billig, according to whom culture ofers a set of shared and accepted commonplaces [3] both in favor and against a given controversial behavior [3]. An example is provided by the debate on Facebook's policy on users' personal data: their policy was justifed in the name of the free, valuable service it provided but also criticized in the name of transparency [41]. Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy. A controversy is an issue that can inspire opposite positions and can be framed within opposite categories [3], [21], [29], [57].

They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities.

This practice substantially weakens the security of passwords. Furthermore, service providers store the passwords in a database which might be attacked and leaked. Passwords are also susceptible to shoulder-surfing and phishing attacks. A possibility to mitigate the impact of these attacks are authentication mechanisms that combine different factors. The combination of two factors is called two-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication combines more than two factors.

Motivated by allegations around democratic votes in both Europe and the US, Forelle et al [17], Baker [6], and the wider research community at politicalbots.org have highlighted the widespread use of bots to disseminate and influence political opinion, \u00d4to boost follower numbers and to retweet the content of political candidates on Twitter, to attack political opponents on Facebook, or to drown out activists\u00d5 conversations on Reddit\u00d5 [58, p4885]. Likewise, Larsson and Moe [30] note the need for researchers and platform developers to deepen their understandings of how bot accounts influence and propagate news and media distribution. Relatedly, Savage et al [48] present an approach for using Twitter bots as a mechanism for calling volunteers to action around social causes, highlighting the ease with which changing the tone of the language expressed by a bot can influence engagement from human social media users [48]. The growing abundance of bot code shared on platforms such as GitHub opens even further opportunities and lowers the level of expertise needed to tailor, deploy and use these software agents for personal, social or political causes [29].", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_5": "level of deliberation.

In their study, Wijenayake et al. [125] manipulated user interactivity and response visibility in an online environment and found that these variables influence the level of conformity of users. Seering et al. found that presenting CAPTCHAs with positive stimuli to users leads them to externalize more positivity of tone and analytical complexity in their arguments [107]. Liang et al. [79] found that the maximum depth of a Reddit thread, and consequently of the respective discussions, was positively related to its rating (difference between up-to downvotes). In addition, Gilbert et al. [50] showed that users' tendency to focus on submissions that have higher rating on the platform resulted in an incidental \"filtering\" of information that would otherwise be of interest to them."}}

method, which can be applied simply in a purely post-hoc analysis, independent of the training process, can enable both understanding of individual models and comparison across models. The interpretation process enables investigation of which identified functional groups correspond to linguistic or task level heuristics that may be employed in well understood non-neural methods for performing the task. Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models. This approach builds on and extends prior work using linguistic and task knowledge to understand the behavior and the results of modern neural models (Shi et al., 2016b;Adi et al., 2016;Conneau et al., 2018).", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_metadata": "Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Pascale Fung | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_metadata": "Authors: \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Sungjin Ahn, Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2016 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_para_3": "Performance of proposed architecture is compared with standard neural network architecture with one hidden layer (\"NN\") (as described in Eq. 1) and a support vector machine (\"SVM\") (Chih-Wei Hsu and Lin, 2003) with linear kernel where the training is performed on labelled source domain and performance is reported on the target domain. \"Gold-standard\" refers to target domain supervised performance of the SVM.

To accomplish this abstraction, we employ a simple approach to identify what we conceptualize as emergent neural pathways, which are specific sets of co-firing neurons that work together as the model makes predictions on the data. To understand the specifics of the function performed by the functional group, we align activation patterns through the group per instance with patterns of relevance for task and linguistic knowledge.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_8": "Three-stage pipelines: (a) The first ORCon-vQA system has been proposed by Qu et al.

This is a crucial baseline to compare with our monoQA model in order to evaluate the reranker and reader performances. We reproduce the MTL of the reranker and reader models and its evaluation results provided by Qu et al.

It is deployed by using three models in the pipeline for comparison with our ORConvQA system, which employs a MTL of the reranker and reader. This comparison is done in order to evaluate the performance of using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately in comparison with the joint learning of the reranker and reader. "}}

to increase its readability and understandability. TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_para_3": "2) I heard the pulse of the besieging sea throb far away all night.

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_metadata": "Authors: Haejun Lee, Drew A. Hudson, Kangwook Lee, Christopher D.

They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

A telic event includes a natural endpoint (\u201cshe walked home\u201d), while an atelic event does not (\u201cshe walked around\u201d). Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work. We also create a new data set of English texts manually annotated with telicity.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_metadata": "Authors: Jing Ma, Wei Gao, Shafiq R.

Studies of human sentence processing have shown comparable susceptibility to interference from irrelevant context elements, depending on semantic and syntactic properties ( Van Dyke, 2007;Parker and Phillips, 2017;Dillon et al., 2013). Systematic comparison of interference effects in humans and in language models stands to shed light on mechanistic similarities and differences in the ways that these language processing systems handle information from prior context.", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_metadata": "Authors: Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2018 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_metadata": "Authors: Mitchell Stern, Jacob Andreas, D.

We experiment with two language pairs: English-to-Chinese (en-zh) and English-to-German (en-de). We mine translations from monolingual CommonCrawl data processed as described above for self-supervised MLM pretraining. After processing, there are 1.17B, 0.6B, 7.73B sentences for Chinese (zh), German (de), and English (en), respectively. LaBSE embeddings are used to pair each non-English sentence with its nearest English neighbor, dropping pairs with a similarity score < 0.6. 20 For en-de and en-zh, we train a model with Transformer-Big (Vaswani et al., 2017) in the following way: First we train the model on the mined data as is for 120k steps with batch size 10k. Then we select the best 20% using Wang  Results in table 7 show the effectiveness of the mined training data. By referencing previous results (Edunov et al., 2018), we see that the model using the en-de mined data yields performance that is only 2.8 BLEU away from performance of the best system that made use of the official WMT17 en-de parallel data. Compare to prior en-zh results (Sennrich et al., 2017), we see that our model using mined en-zh training data is as good as a WMT17 NMT model that is trained on the official WMT en-zh parallel data. The table also gives BLEU performance on the TED test set (Qi et al., 2018), with performance of models trained on our mined training data being comparable with models trained using CCMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2019). 21", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_metadata": "Authors: Antoine Bosselut, Hannah Rashkin, Maarten Sap, Chaitanya Malaviya, Asli Celikyilmaz, Yejin Choi | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways"}}

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).",

To document sacrifcial animal production, mobilization, and marketing, we selected fve villages (Talgachi, Garadoho, Purantepri, Mushipur, and Barabil) of Sirajganj District, which were popular for raising cattle heads for Eid. After selecting these villages, the ethnographer reached out to people in her social network to access the farmers' communities in each of these villages. For each of these villages, we had more than one 'gatekeepers' [90]. The gatekeepers would live in those villages for at least ten years, and they were also connected to cattle farms and farmers' communities there. In these villages we interviewed 7 khamaris, 12 byaparis, and 14 individual farmers (8 men, 6 women). The age of these participants ranged from 22-50 yrs. Eleven among them never received any formal education. The interviews were semi-structured and were 30-40 minutes long on average. We asked them about their farm's business model, the impacts of digitization of the country on their farm, and their future plans, among others. We also asked the farmers about their cattle-raising processes and their experiences of staying in Dhaka for selling their cattle heads during Eid ul Adha. We observed and took note of the cattle-raising spaces and associated infrastructures as well. We then had fve focus group discussions with the farmers, political leaders (popularly known as 'Chairman'), and the byaparis. In these FGDs, we discussed how they worked together to arrange the \"chalan\" or supply of cattle heads before Eid, how the Chairmen infuenced the overall process, and how convenient mobile phone applications (Imo, Viber, What-sApp, etc.) were for the farmers, among others. The participants' ages ranged from 25-60 yrs. In total, 19 people participated in these 5 FGDs (4-8 participants in one group). Each FGD was 40 minutes long on average. Although female members of the farmers' families (who were directly involved with the cattle-raising process) participated in the individual interviews, they were not present in the FGDs following the village norms. Both the interviews and FGDs followed the local cultural norms.

We extend this line of work by arguing for incorporating marginalized communities' voices as part of an engagement with program and policy makers into the decision-making process. Our findings highlight that this incorporation is often challenged by various internal and external factors in the local governing system. By considering the interactions among diverse top-down institutions [58,76,114,115] their institutioning, the intermediaries involved (such as multi-sectoral actors in government INGOs and donor agencies), and the dynamics of intermediation, we can articulate how they work and where HCI can contribute in the processes of digital innovations with and for marginalized communities.

Thousands of products and services are being published, promoted, and purchased over various online platforms ranging from government-developed websites to personal Facebook pages of the sellers [20,66,100]. One of the newest additions of this trend is the digitization of the 'physical' cattle markets (traditionally held in the urban areas during Eid), which has received signifcant attention in Bangladesh recently. Such transformations often engender many socio-cultural tensions and put the efort of digitizing the countries in the Global South into question. While a rich body of literature in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD), and related felds has focused on diferent aspects of digital marketplaces [36,50,59,101], very few studies have been conducted in the context of the Global South [42,104,131].

To address this gap, we take the case of Bangladesh as a typical Global South context in which development work is carried out by a complex intertwined network of stakeholders across governments, NGOs, donors, and industries. To better understand the current development landscape and its priorities for digital technologies, we conducted interviews with 14 influential decision-makers in Bangladesh who play significant roles in the development of nutrition strategies. Our findings highlight a disconnect between the Bangladesh government's \"digital mandate\" and the reality of digital innovation practice within the nutrition development sector.

Partly driven by a political mandate to engage youth explicitly as part of their digital innovation strategy, our participants argued for leveraging youth potential, seeing them as agents of change. This a priori interest in youth engagement signifies how decisionmakers think of population segments, which will be key in successful innovation diffusion. Notably, this is not limited only to creating youth-friendly applications or creating \"lite\" youth versions of apps aimed at adults. Youth are traditionally construed as \"human becomings,\" \"denigrating their present lives, while focusing only on the adults they will become\" [7]. For decision-makers, the youth of today have an essential role to play in Bangladesh's digital innovation narrative in the present. This is also a strategic decision when it is considered that 40% of the country's population is under the age of 18, a phenomenon that is not exclusive to Bangladesh [104]. The UK's leading development institute, ODI, argues that since the world now has the largest generation aged 15-24 in history (and 90% of these youth live in Global South countries), a unique opportunity is afforded to development practitioners and theorists. There is \"a one-time window of opportunity for a concerted international effort to help developing countries reap a 'demographic dividend' from educated, healthy and gainfully employed young women and men, and achieve far higher economic growth rates\" [96]. However, we also urge caution here and advise that any attempts to mediate youth engagement with decision-makers needs to be carried out with the utmost care. Though ostensibly motivated by youth empowerment, authorities as well as non-state actors have repeatedly sought to disrupt spaces for youth participation or co-opt them towards their own political agendas. Moreover, if development projects consider youth perspectives and motivations for development, they can be included in initiatives whose primary target populations are adults. For instance, when targeting information dissemination to women farmers, we should consider young people's role as change-makers in farming communities. Hence, we recommend that every national and regional development context has population segments that are prioritized for innovation roll-out due to factors such as high early adoption rates or alignment with national agendas. When configuring projects, we recommend that HCI researchers consider how their projects will leverage these population segments to maximize their impact.", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_0": "Stance detection aims to automatically identify one's opinionated standpoint/attitude (e.g. Pro, Con, or Neutral, etc.) expressed in text towards a specific proposition, topic, or target (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Augenstein et al., 2016;Mohammad et al., 2016;Sobhani et al., 2017).

The massive globalization [123], intercontinental migrations [142], and forced mobilities of the refugees [98,109] have started to question diferent aspects of the modern secular urban planning systems of the West [31]. For the last few decades, the geopolitics of the religious have received a great deal of attention as the cities of diferent parts of the world are observing a rise in religious nationalism, fundamentalism, and communal violence [58]. Hence, in this era of globalization, religiosity is neither a unique 'feature' of the Global South, nor is there a dichotomy between the North and the South. However, since in the Global South, urban religion and the city coexist from the very beginning, scholars like Robert Orsi have suggested looking at the regional scholarly work from the Global South to understand the necessity of dynamic engagement of religion with the city [106].", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming"}}

Researchers have been working on presenting various methods of projecting viewpoint images from multiple projectors onto a screen with narrow diffusion characteristics [33,19,18,22]. In such a multi-view 3D display, the number of viewpoints is increased to smooth changes between viewpoints, present the binocular parallax, and widen the visual field area. A uniform viewpoint distribution is necessary for extending the viewing zone over 360-degree  horizontal directions around the table. Conventional methods  of expanding the viewing area to 360 degrees around the table   are roughly divided into a time division method, like a rotation mechanism, and a space division method with multiple  displays or projectors. Jones et al. [17] proposed a time division method that presents 360-degree 3D images with a high-speed video projector and a rotating mirror covered with a holographic diffuser. Inoue et al. [14] proposed a rotating screen system that uses a microelectro-mechanical systems spatial light modulator (MEMS SLM). Takaki et al. [45] proposed a configuration that has three projectors and a rotating screen. The systems of Inoue and Takaki both use a screen that is constructed with a Fresnel lens whose optical axis is shifted to focus light at the users' positions. With a configuration that uses a rotating mirror or a screen, the users' hands cannot be brought close to the 3D objects for their own safety. Butler et al. [4] proposed a 360-degree 3D display in which hands can be brought close to a 3D object because there is a rotating screen and a highspeed digital micromirror device (DMD) projector under the two parabolic mirrors placed opposite each other, and the 3D image is imaged in the air.

We placed a diffusion screen at the observation position (about 850 mm from the center of the screen), then projected a uniform white light on the spatially imaged iris plane screen and measured the luminance distribution of the focused image on the diffusion screen with a two-dimensional luminance meter (HI-LAND RISA-COLOR/ONE5). Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the 2D luminance distributions and 1D luminance distributions of one projector. Figure 11 shows results without a diffusion layer, and Figure 12 shows results with a diffusion layer. The horizontal 1D luminance distribution was measured at a height of 1700 mm, and the vertical distribution was measured at the center of the projector. Figure 11 shows that the Fresnel lens collected the light without spreading in the horizontal direction, and Figure 12 shows that the diffusion layer had smooth attenuation characteristics in the horizontal direction. In Figure 12, the height range of upper than half value (blue line) is 1400 mm to 1900 mm, so the distribution widened vertically due to the distortion of the imaged iris plane. This characteristic ensured linear blending even when the users' heights differed.   In the 1D luminance distribution of the screen without diffusion (Figure 11), the width of upper than half value including the peak is about 10 mm (0.7 degrees), and is 100 mm (6.7 degrees) with diffusion ( Figure 12). Since light passes through the diffusion layer twice, the diffusion angle of the diffusion film used in this implementation is estimated to be about 3 degrees. Figure 13 shows one-dimensional luminance distributions by the five adjacent projectors. This figure shows that the screen smoothed the transition between adjacent viewpoint images with viewpoint movement by superimposing the luminance. Figure 14 shows 360-degree photographs of the projected image. The upper in Figure 14 is a checkerboard-pattern 3D cube. This figure shows that the object can be observed from the entire circumference without distortion. The lower in Figure 14 shows that different angle images of car contents corresponding to the viewpoint positions in the horizontal direction were observed. We could also confirm the effect of stereoscopic vision due to binocular parallax and smooth motion parallax in actual observation. Figure 15 shows the users' bones by image recognition in a 360-degree camera image. Human bones are detected despite some distortion in the vertical direction from the image correction of the 360-degree camera. Since the 360-degree camera is mounted at almost the same height as the users' faces, the upper bodies of the standing users can be detected even when the tabletop screen hides the lower bodies of the users. The frame rate of detection was stable at 11 to 13 fps. Figure 16 shows the observed images with and without head tracking when the viewpoint heights were changed to three levels. Without head tracking, a red teapot appears to be collapsed by perspective distortion at low viewpoints, but the distortion was reduced with tracking. The figure shows that our prototype provides the correct angle of 3D content according to viewpoint height changes and more accurate representation through head tracking.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_para_2": "To distribute the points along one or more axes, the user can use the distribute action ( Figure 6).

The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions.

All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_metadata": "Authors: K.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

Many open questions remain regarding the sociolinguistic underpinnings of written code-switching, and progress has been limited by a lack of suitable resources. We introduce a novel, large, and diverse dataset of written code-switched productions, curated from topical threads of multiple bilingual communities on the Reddit discussion platform, and explore questions that were mainly addressed in the context of spoken language thus far. We investigate whether findings in oral code-switching concerning content and style, as well as speaker proficiency, are carried over into written code-switching in discussion forums. The released dataset can further facilitate a range of research and practical activities.", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_metadata": "Authors: Lalchand Pandia, Allyson Ettinger | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_metadata": "Authors: Cheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Qun Liu | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_metadata": "Authors: Yujia Qin, Yankai Lin, Ryuichi Takanobu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_metadata": "Authors: Min-Hsuan Yeh, Lun-Wei Ku | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_5": "As a study that sets out to describe and explain rather than create, this work of action research brings together virtual ethnography [11] with the emerging practice of \"popular data,\" where researchers and participants create questions and interpretations together [10,19].

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_3": "More recently, semantic matching methods were proposed to retrieve evidence from relatively trustworthy sources such as checked news and Wikipedia articles. Popat et al. (2018) attempted to debunk false claims by learning claim representations from relevant articles using an attention mechanism to focus on words that are closely related to the claim. Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules. Similar pipelines were developed by most of the participating teams (Nie et al., 2019;Padia et al., 2018;Alhindi et al., 2018;Hanselowski et al., 2018) in FEVER shared task (Thorne et al., 2018b).

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_2": "\u2022 We propose a new benchmark for pre-training LMs to be aware of common table-based operations by automatically synthesizing sentencetable cloze questions from WikiTables.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

For example, some existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021 have applied MTL on reranking and answer reading by adding two fully-connected layers (one for the reranker and reader, respectively) to find an answer span for the retrieved passages (start/end positions).

It receives increasing attentions from research communities recently, due to its broad applications in scenarios of dialogue system and educational reading comprehension (Piwek et al., 2007;. It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text. One possible reason causing the problem is that current sequenceto-sequence models learn a latent representation for the input text without explicitly modeling semantic information included. We therefore argue that modeling facts in the input text can help to alleviate the problem of existing neural QG models.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_abstract": "To address the Conversational Question Answering (ORConvQA) task, previous work has considered an effective three-stage architecture, consisting of a retriever, a reranker, and a reader to extract the answers. In order to effectively answer the users\u2019 questions, a number of existing approaches have applied multi-task learning, such that the same model is shared between the reranker and the reader. Such approaches also typically tackle reranking and reading as classification tasks. On the other hand, recent text generation models, such as monoT5 and UnifiedQA, have been shown to respectively yield impressive performances in passage reranking and reading. However, no prior work has combined monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model that directly extracts the answers for the users instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.

Our results on the OR-QuAC and OR-CoQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which significantly outperforms existing strong baselines with improvements ranging from +12.31% to +19.51% in MAP and from +5.70% to +23.34% in F1 on all used test sets.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_abstract": "Existing research for question generation encodes the input text as a sequence of tokens without explicitly modeling fact information. These models tend to generate irrelevant and uninformative questions. In this paper, we explore to incorporate facts in the text for question generation in a comprehensive way. We present a novel task of question generation given a query path in the knowledge graph constructed from the input text. We divide the task into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate query representation learning as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query and employ an RNN-based generator for question generation. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion, and further enforce the interaction between these two modules in a variational framework. We construct the experimental datasets on top of SQuAD and results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance margin is larger when target questions are complex. Human evaluation also proves that our model is able to generate relevant and informative questions.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_3": "On the other hand, Nogueira et al. (2020) proposed monoT5, a text generation model, which was fine-tuned to generate the tokens \"true\" or \"false\" depending on whether the document is relevant or not to the query. Indeed, the monoT5 model has been shown to outperform BERT-based models in passage reranking (Nogueira et al., 2020). In addition, many studies (Raffel et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020; have focused on developing a generative reader which is fine-tuned as a text generation model to extract the answer from the passage. In particular, Khashabi et al. (2020) introduced the UnifiedQA model, which has been shown to yield impressive performances on many extractive QA datasets. However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has combined monoT5 and UnifiedQA by sharing a single text generation model, in order to directly extract the answers instead of predicting the start/end positions in a retrieved passage.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_8": "Three-stage pipelines: (a) The first ORCon-vQA system has been proposed by Qu et al.

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever. We also consider other recent existing bi-encoder passage retrievers such as TCT-ColBERT (Lin et al., 2021b, 2020a and CQE (Lin et al., 2021a) as baseline passage retrievers.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_metadata": "Authors: Junsheng Zhou, Feiyu Xu, H.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

There has been much work on unsupervised cross-lingual dependency parsing by direct source treebank transferring. Several researchers investigate delexicalized models where only non-lexical features are used in the models (Zeman and Resnik, 2008;Cohen et al., 2011;McDonald et al., 2011;Naseem et al., 2012;Rosa and Zabokrtsky, 2015). All the features in these models are language independent, and are consistent across languages and treebanks. Thus they can be applied into target languages directly."}}

It receives increasing attentions from research communities recently, due to its broad applications in scenarios of dialogue system and educational reading comprehension (Piwek et al., 2007;. It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text. One possible reason causing the problem is that current sequenceto-sequence models learn a latent representation for the input text without explicitly modeling semantic information included. We therefore argue that modeling facts in the input text can help to alleviate the problem of existing neural QG models.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_abstract": "Existing research for question generation encodes the input text as a sequence of tokens without explicitly modeling fact information.

However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever.

Somewhat more similar to ours is work like Elazar et al. (2021), which explores the consistency of models' generation of facts in the face of rephrasing of prompts.

In this work, we aim to provide task distributions for meta-learning by considering self-supervised tasks automatically proposed from unlabeled text, to enable large-scale meta-learning in NLP. We design multiple distributions of self-supervised tasks by considering important aspects of task diversity, difficulty, type, domain, and curriculum, and investigate how they affect meta-learning performance. Our analysis shows that all these factors meaningfully alter the task distribution, some inducing significant improvements in downstream few-shot accuracy of the meta-learned models.

Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

Specifically, we show an example in Figure 1, to understand that \"Guadalajara is located in Mexico\", we need to consider the following clues jointly: (i) \"Mexico\" is the country of \"Culiac\u00e1n\" from sentence 1; (ii) \"Culiac\u00e1n\" is a rail junction lo-cated on \"Panamerican Highway\" from sentence 6; (iii) \"Panamerican Highway\" connects to \"Guadalajara\" from sentence 6. From the example, we can see that there are two main challenges to capture the in-text relational facts:", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words"}}

On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_para_2": "To distribute the points along one or more axes, the user can use the distribute action ( Figure 6).

The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

It receives increasing attentions from research communities recently, due to its broad applications in scenarios of dialogue system and educational reading comprehension (Piwek et al., 2007;. It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\". Although Q1 is correct, it is a safe play without mentioning any specific information in the input text.

Contrastingly, Nashei et al [38] highlight that good questions on the same platform tend to encourage continued discussion where the initial problem gets redefined. Similarly, those responses that work best tend to be those that are concise, refer back to the question asked, highlight key elements, and provide step-by-step instructions and explore multiple solutions. Furthermore, studies of expert online communities of programmers have highlighted the importance of timely responses, both from those asking a question and those proposing answers [40].", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_6": "Since our formative study indicated that chatbot designers wish to obtain certain quantitative feedback on the performance of their existing chatbot (T1), we first formulated a computational framework that quantitatively measures the effectiveness of such an interview chatbot from multiple aspects.

For example, Bohus and Rudnicky introduce dialog systems that gather required information for performing specific tasks (e.g., making travel reservations) [4]. More recently, a number of interview chatbots have been developed to elicit information from a target audience. For example, a chatbot is built to interview students for effective teaming [66] and another chatbot to interview gamers for eliciting their game opinions [67]. Williams et al. have developed a chatbot to interview employees for workplace productivity [64]. Compared to traditional, static online surveys, these interview chatbots enhance information elicitation [31,66] by providing interactive feedback [8] and asking follow-up questions [46]. Our work is directly related to the efforts of creating interview chatbots. However, existing work focuses on developing interview chatbots for specific information elicitation tasks (e.g., [64,66,67]) or powering interview chatbots with specific skills (e.g., giving them a personality [71] and active listening skills [65]). While we learn from these efforts, our work reported here has a very different focus: we want to build a tool that can automatically evaluate the performance of an interview chatbot and provide design suggestions for improving the chatbot.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_4": "To map out the set of potentially useful task types, we examined the literature for works that have conducted IVR surveys or quizzes (e.g. [8,20,44,50,60,61]). We then implemented sufficient capabilities in Karamad to accommodate all tasks that we intended to deploy. Karamad currently supports Yes-No (binary) questions, multiple choice questions (MCQ), short and long answer questions. Binary questions and multiple choice questions require a single key press as input. Short and long answer questions require free-form 30 and 60 second voice recordings. We did not implement longer speech recordings or multiple digit inputs in Karamad that have been used in the past by IVR-based services [8,41,49,50]. We made Prior work reports that multiple-digit input can be complex for users and suggests incorporating examples to address this issue [8]. We took the approach of restructuring multi-digit input prompts into multiple-choices by segmenting possible answers into ranges. For example, rather than asking for a user's age as multi-digit answer, we reframe the question into a multiple choice question with responses in the form of ranges such as <20, 21-30, 31-40, >40. This approach is less precise, but it is also less complex for users and less expensive overall as including usage examples in the question statement requires more airtime. Similarly, when MCQs exceed 9 choices, we divide into sets of 8 options followed by the \"other\" choice, leading to the next 8 options.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_abstract": "While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

This paper further depicts how such secularization contributes to diminishing rural-urban linkages, affecting electoral politics, and reducing the tolerance to religious celebrations in a city.

We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_3": "Inspired by the success of BERT-like models (Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019;Clark et al., 2020) in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, many existing studies leverage pre-trained LMs for table understanding, achieving superior results (Chen et al., 2020b;Schlichtkrull et al., 2021).

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors.

(2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever. We also consider other recent existing bi-encoder passage retrievers such as TCT-ColBERT (Lin et al., 2021b, 2020a and CQE (Lin et al., 2021a) as baseline passage retrievers.", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_para_2": "Comparison to supervised learning DailyDialog is used to compare our FSL approach with recent supervised learning results on ERC. As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model. As expected, performance is lower on the Live Chat Customer Service corpus.", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_para_4": "These findings also have implications for studying mechanistic connections between pre-trained language models and language processing in humans. Studies of human sentence processing have shown comparable susceptibility to interference from irrelevant context elements, depending on semantic and syntactic properties ( Van Dyke, 2007;Parker and Phillips, 2017;Dillon et al., 2013). Systematic comparison of interference effects in humans and in language models stands to shed light on mechanistic similarities and differences in the ways that these language processing systems handle information from prior context.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_para_4": "After differing redundant heads from those important ones in the multi-head self-attention, we further enliven the redundant heads with a syntactic bias per Eq. (4) or Eq. (6) without interfering with the important head functions. (Voita et al., 2019) shows that redundant heads are mostly distributed in the lower encoder layers, meanwhile (Hao et al., 2019; shows that the bottom layer in the encoder, which directly takes word embedding as input, benefits more from modeling local relations. We evaluate the performance of applying our method on the low-and high-level encoder layers in the next section, and obtain the best performance when applying on the first encoder layer.  (Collins et al., 2005). The byte-pair encoding (BPE) toolkit 2 (Sennrich et al., 2016) is used with 32K merge operations. The 4-gram NIST BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) is used as the evaluation metric. We implement the proposed RHE and all the baselines on top of Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by using open-source toolkit OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017). Please refer to the Appendix for more details of dataset and parameter setting . Table 1 shows the ablation study results of the Transformer enabled by the two proposed SEA mechanisms DEA and LPEA and the RHE approach. First, the Rows of \"+DEA\" and \"+LPE\" represent the models with all heads of the first encoder layer, including original important heads, are replaced by the syntax-enhanced attention networks DEA and LPEA respectively. Second, the RHE approach (containing the Rows of \"+DEA+RHE\" and \"+LPEA+RHE\" ) significantly lifts both DEA and LPEA mechanisms across all small and large language pairs. This tests the effectiveness of identifying and modifying redundant heads without interfering important head functions. RHE lifts the LPEA, which together i.e. LPEA+RHE substantially outperforms Transformer by +1.0 BLEU points on En\u2192De (WMT16), +0.96 BLEU points on En\u2192De (WMT14), and +0.81 BLEU points on En\u2192Cs (WMT16). These results demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of both SEA and RHE designs.", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_4": "Nevertheless, while this approach can model more complex interactions, some of these can only occur indirectly inside the backtracking of their beam search. Furthermore, the disambiguation involves an auto-regressive decoding that, although mitigated by later efforts (De Cao et al., 2021a), has intrinsic speed limitations. In contrast, here we propose an extractive formulation, where a model receives as input the mention, its context and the text representation of each candidate, and has to extract the span corresponding to the representation of the entity that best matches the (mention, context) pair under consideration. Note that this differs from the aforementioned cross-encoder formulations (Logeswaran et al., 2019; where, instead, each entity was encoded together with the (mention, context) pair, but independently from all the other entities. With our schema, complex mention-entity and entity-entity interactions can be explicitly modeled by the neural system, as all the information is provided in input.", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_abstract": "Structured document understanding has attracted considerable attention and made significant progress recently, owing to its crucial role in intelligent document processing. However, most existing related models can only deal with the document data of specific language(s) (typically English) included in the pre-training collection, which is extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

In this work, we transfer this ability to FEVER and gauge the feasibility of such closed-world reasoning.

We construct the anonymized version by masking prominent named entities in the claim-evidence pairs, thereby reducing any reliance on pre-trained factual knowledge.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_4": "In the absence of any other direct baseline for end-to-end TS, we consider the following unsupervised baselines.

To use this framework, we treated the set of simple and complex sentences as two different languages. Same model configuration as reported by Artetxe et al. (2018b) is used. We use the term UNMT for this system. Similar to the UNMT system, we also consider unsupervised statistical machine translation (termed as USMT) proposed by Artetxe et al.

Coherence Evaluation: According to the coherence theory of truth, the truth of any (true) proposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of propositions (Young, 2018). In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency. Textual Entailment: Entailment is used to measure whether a piece of evidence semantically infers a given claim. We propose an entailmentbased attention component that can be pre-trained to capture entailment relations (Dagan et al., 2010;Bowman et al., 2015) based on sentence pairs labeled with NLI-specific classes: entails, contradicts and neutral. This pre-trained component together with the entire claim verification framework then will be trained end-to-end to attend on the salient sentences for inferring the claim."}}

There are nearly 0.8M referring expressions of which 32% of expressions refer to only a single object (Single-referent) and 68% refer to more than one object (Multi-referent). In this paper, we refer to the full dataset as F-Ref and the single-referent subset as S-Ref. Module network (Liu et al., 2019;Johnson et al., 2017a;Andreas et al., 2016b) based architectures achieved new state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_abstract": "Recurrent and convolutional neural networks comprise two distinct families of models that have proven to be useful for encoding natural language utterances. In this paper we present SoPa, a new model that aims to bridge these two approaches. SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_para_2": "Baselines We report the performance of our method against the models trained in Sap et al.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_metadata": "Authors: Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Year: 2018 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_abstract": "This paper addresses the automatic recognition of telicity, an aspectual notion.

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows.

However, most existing related models can only deal with the document data of specific language(s) (typically English) included in the pre-training collection, which is extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_metadata": "Authors: Devamardeep Hayatpur, Haijun Xia, Daniel J.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses . We also collected the participants' demographics, including their gender and age, and their chatbot experience (chatbot interaction or design experience).", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

According to previous work [19,38], when a human produces a very rapid stroke, the trajectory is nearly straight and there might be up to two reversals in the direction of the motion (known as \"glitches\"), either at the beginning or at the end of the trajectory. Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation. These observations are key to our method."}}

However, it is unknown whether this sort of visual estimation is reliable in more complex scenarios, or if there are strategies by which a visualization designer can intervene in order to promote better estimates. After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_0": "Stance detection aims to automatically identify one's opinionated standpoint/attitude (e.g. Pro, Con, or Neutral, etc.) expressed in text towards a specific proposition, topic, or target (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Augenstein et al., 2016;Mohammad et al., 2016;Sobhani et al., 2017).

Data that is distributed along three properties creates a 3D scatter plot. Jeffery can use this action to explore the distribution of different properties, for example, by year. The resulting histogram shows Jeffery that this dataset has a rich archive of movies, dating all the way back to late 19 th century. Jeffery is now curious if this catalogue of movies also contains non-Western cinema. So, he distributes the data by the longitude and latitude of where the movie was produced, creating a 2D map of movies from around the world. Because the points overlap each other, Jeffery cannot see the number of points at different locations, so he looks at the 3D histogram to see the density of points at different latitude and longitude positions.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours. Other related work on predicting aspect include systems aiming at identifying lexical aspect (Siegel and McKeown, 2000;Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) or habituals (Mathew and Katz, 2009;Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015).", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_metadata": "Authors: Justin Matejka, Michael Glueck, Tovi Grossman, G.

applicability to linear blending. We placed a diffusion screen at the observation position (about 850 mm from the center of the screen), then projected a uniform white light on the spatially imaged iris plane screen and measured the luminance distribution of the focused image on the diffusion screen with a two-dimensional luminance meter (HI-LAND RISA-COLOR/ONE5). Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the 2D luminance distributions and 1D luminance distributions of one projector. Figure 11 shows results without a diffusion layer, and Figure 12 shows results with a diffusion layer. The horizontal 1D luminance distribution was measured at a height of 1700 mm, and the vertical distribution was measured at the center of the projector. Figure 11 shows that the Fresnel lens collected the light without spreading in the horizontal direction, and Figure 12 shows that the diffusion layer had smooth attenuation characteristics in the horizontal direction. In Figure 12, the height range of upper than half value (blue line) is 1400 mm to 1900 mm, so the distribution widened vertically due to the distortion of the imaged iris plane. This characteristic ensured linear blending even when the users' heights differed.   In the 1D luminance distribution of the screen without diffusion (Figure 11), the width of upper than half value including the peak is about 10 mm (0.7 degrees), and is 100 mm (6.7 degrees) with diffusion ( Figure 12). Since light passes through the diffusion layer twice, the diffusion angle of the diffusion film used in this implementation is estimated to be about 3 degrees. Figure 13 shows one-dimensional luminance distributions by the five adjacent projectors. This figure shows that the screen smoothed the transition between adjacent viewpoint images with viewpoint movement by superimposing the luminance. Figure 14 shows 360-degree photographs of the projected image. The upper in Figure 14 is a checkerboard-pattern 3D cube. This figure shows that the object can be observed from the entire circumference without distortion. The lower in Figure 14 shows that different angle images of car contents corresponding to the viewpoint positions in the horizontal direction were observed. We could also confirm the effect of stereoscopic vision due to binocular parallax and smooth motion parallax in actual observation. Figure 15 shows the users' bones by image recognition in a 360-degree camera image. Human bones are detected despite some distortion in the vertical direction from the image correction of the 360-degree camera. Since the 360-degree camera is mounted at almost the same height as the users' faces, the upper bodies of the standing users can be detected even when the tabletop screen hides the lower bodies of the users. The frame rate of detection was stable at 11 to 13 fps. Figure 16 shows the observed images with and without head tracking when the viewpoint heights were changed to three levels.

Datasets containing real images and expressions such as RefCOCO+ (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014) and Ref-COCOg (Mao et al., 2016) have been proposed to evaluate the progress on this task. Multi-modal transformers (Lu et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019;Tan and Bansal, 2019), using pretrain-then-transfer approach, have shown superior performance on these datasets. However, these models fail to learn robust visio-linguistic contextual representations and are shown to exploit the imbalanced distribution in the train and test splits (Akula et al., 2020a;Cirik et al., 2018). Recently, CLEVR-Ref+ (Liu et al., 2019) has been introduced as a synthetic diagnostic benchmark that allows control over dataset bias. There are nearly 0.8M referring expressions of which 32% of expressions refer to only a single object (Single-referent) and 68% refer to more than one object (Multi-referent). In this paper, we refer to the full dataset as F-Ref and the single-referent subset as S-Ref.

We elucidate how SMBs in Kenya adapted to the impact of COVID-19, and in particular, how technology was employed to assist in addressing the challenges of this period. Research has evidenced that the COVID-19 pandemic was not only a health crisis, but also prompted widespread technological disruption [7]. This phenomenon was reflected in our research through the widespread digital transformation of SMBs. However, the majority of the technologies adopted were not designed with the African business in mind. Rather they were designed in and for the Global North. Research shows that just porting such technologies from one setting -with its specific orientations and concerns -to another setting is not always effective nor beneficial [8][9][10][11]. If we wish to enable digital transformation which enhances productivity among businesses in Africa, it is important to design with the opportunities and contingencies of work in Africa in mind. This research is a step in this direction, providing a rich understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the digital transformation of SMBs in Kenya.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_abstract": "Small and Medium sized Businesses (SMBs) make up majority of employment in Africa (around 80%). Understanding the digital transformation that SMBs in Africa went through during the pandemic can play an important role in uncovering how to build solutions that better support the African business and African worker. In this paper we report on findings from a qualitative study with 40 SMBs in Kenya. The study aimed to understand the lived experience of digital transformation, the impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses, and how they responded to such impacts using technology. We found that COVID-prompted digital transformation was reactive and opportunistic, plus social and collective. Moreover, the socialness of business goes way beyond digital transformation, and influences how SMBs in Kenya start, develop and are sustained. In illustrating this, we offer a lens to understanding work and workers of SMBs in Kenya and similar contexts across the globe.", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_para_6": "Heike Adel and Hinrich Sch\u00fctze. 2017.

We introduce MYND: An open-source framework that couples consumer-grade recording hardware with an easy-to-use application for the unsupervised evaluation of BCI control strategies. Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording, and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires at home. As a use case, thirty subjects evaluated two BCI control strategies \"Positive memories\" and \"Music imagery\" by using a four-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) with MYND.

Most importantly, they induce modulation of neural activity in broad areas of the cortex, which could make them particularly suitable for use with consumer-grade EEG equipment with few sensors. We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4]. Now, we complement the laboratory results with MYND to investigate whether these strategies can be executed in an uncontrolled, realistic environment, by utilizing a consumer-grade EEG, and if

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept.

With this study, we aim to evaluate how well the BCI control strategies can be performed in an uncontrolled, realistic setting and consumer-grade hardware, outside of the laboratory. The small amount of trials scheduled per day (18 to 36), recorded with a consumer-grade EEG, makes it challenging to learn a good decoding model per subject, day, and strategy. To solve this problem, we leveraged the information obtained from previous laboratory trials with a transfer-learning approach ( [39], toolbox available online 6 , additional details in [11]). Here, a linear regression model for each subject in the at-home study is learned while regularizing the regression weights with a Gaussian prior that is learned on existing laboratory data.

Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1. Given n references (ground-truth answers) for each question, human F1 is calculated by averaging the maximum F1 from each n\u22121 subset with respect to the heldout reference (Choi et al., 2018).

In this paper we present SoPa, a new model that aims to bridge these two approaches. SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_para_3": "Weighted finite-state automata. WFSAs and hidden Markov models 19 were once popular in automatic speech recognition (Hetherington, 2004;Moore et al., 2006;Hoffmeister et al., 2012) 19 HMMs are a special case of WFSAs (Mohri et al., 2002). and remain popular in morphology (Dreyer, 2011;Cotterell et al., 2015). Most closely related to this work, neural networks have been combined with weighted finite-state transducers to do morphological reinflection (Rastogi et al., 2016). These prior works learn a single FSA or FST, whereas our model learns a collection of simple but complementary FSAs, together encoding a sequence.

Our approach differs from other recent chart-based neural models (e.g. Durrett and Klein (2015)) in the use of a recurrent input representation, structured loss function, and comparatively simple parameterization of the scoring function.

From a modeling perspective, SoPa is interesting because WF-SAs are well-studied and come with efficient and flexible inference algorithms (Mohri, 1997;Eisner, 2002) that SoPa can take advantage of. SoPa defines a set of soft patterns of different lengths, with each pattern represented as a WFSA (Section 3). While the number and lengths of the patterns are hyperparameters, the patterns themselves are learned end-to-end. SoPa then represents a document with a vector that is the aggregate of the scores computed by matching each of the patterns with each span in the document. Because SoPa defines a hidden state that depends on the input token and the previous state, it can be thought of as a simple type of RNN. We show that SoPa is an extension of a onelayer CNN (Section 4). Accordingly, one-layer CNNs can be viewed as a collection of linearchain WFSAs, each of which can only match fixed-length spans, while our extension allows matches of flexible-length. As a simple type of RNN that is more expressive than a CNN, SoPa helps to link CNNs and RNNs.", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_metadata": "Authors: Mingyang Zhou, Josh Arnold, Zhou Yu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2019 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_metadata": "Authors: A.

The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work. Some works (Gong et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020;Gu et al., 2021) propose progressive learning to accelerate the pre-training, which are motivated by the fact that different layers have some similar knowledge (e.g., attention patterns). They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) proposes a task of replaced token detection to predict whether each token in the input was replaced or not, which improves the pre-training efficiency. Our method is orthogonal to this kind of work and the combination of ELECTRA and bert2BERT could achieve better efficiency. In addition, there are several other orthogonal techniques for efficient pre-training: mixed-precision training (Shoeybi et al., 2019), large batch optimization (You et al., 2020), model architecture innovation , layer dropping technique , etc.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_para_0": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), GPT (Radford et al., 2018(Radford et al., , 2019Brown et al., 2020), ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and RoBERTa , have achieved great 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 FLOPs (1e19)  StackBERT (Gong et al., 2019) is based on the progressive training setting.

There are mainly two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language rep-resentations to down-stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_2": "Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stance for destination unseen targets by learning stance features from known targets (Allaway and McKeown, 2020). To deal with zero-shot stance detection, Allaway and McKeown (2020) created a new dataset consisting of a large range of topics covering broad themes, called Varied Stance Topics (VAST). Based on it, they proposed a topic-grouped attention model to implicitly capture relationships between targets by using generalized topic representations. Allaway et al.

It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent pieces of evidence, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidence as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We prepared a few questions for every principal view that aimed to stimulate feedback. Following the design exploration, we asked the physicists to respond to a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire, structured as follows: \u2022 An abbreviated Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) scale was used, as it provides two valuable subscales. We considered assessing the perceived Value / Usefulness (5 items) to be of key importance for gamification in science, as well as Interest / Enjoyment (4 items). Enjoyment has also been used to characterize user preferences of game design elements by Tondello et al. [41]. The interest / enjoyment subscale assesses intrinsic motivation per se, while task meaningfulness appeals to the innate need for autonomy [38]. \u2022 We further asked to rate a statement that targets the suitability of the design: The system is NOT suitable for a research preservation service.

Following our initial expectation that gamification in a professional scientific context is most likely to profit from a serious, informative and rule-based design language, we created the Rational-Informative Design (RID) that provides information expected to appeal to HEP researchers. The RID was designed to make less use of most common game elements like points and leaderboards. Instead, it uses elements of \"Social networks\", \"Social discovery\", \"Signposting\" and \"Challenges\" (the LHC collaboration goal on the dashboard) as suggested by Tondello et al. [41]. This enables an exploration of gameful design elements in the HEP context. Yet, as scientists are already subjected to a high degree of competition, we also created a contrasting Simple Game Elements Design (SGED) version that focuses on point-based rewards and competitive elements. The basic UI design rules (color scheme, arrangements, etc.) are the same for both versions and are inspired by the actual service design. We built interactive wireframes with a high level of detail using the prototyping tool Balsamiq. As it is impractical to develop two functional, productive designs for the purpose of studying perceptions, we decided in favor of fully interactive prototypes. This approach is also motivated by recent, novel research methods, mapping persuasive strategies to gamification user types based on storyboards [34].", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_abstract": "We present a vision for conversational user interfaces (CUIs) as probes for speculating with, rather than as objects to speculate about. Popular CUIs, e.g., Alexa, are changing the way we converse, narrate, and imagine the world(s) to come. Yet, current conversational interactions normatively may promote non-desirable ends, delivering a restricted range of request-response interactions with sexist and digital colonialist tendencies. Our critical design approach envisions alternatives by considering how future voices can reside in CUIs as enabling probes. We present novel explorations that illustrate the potential of CUIs as critical design material, by critiquing present norms and conversing with imaginary species. As micro-level interventions, we show that conversations with diverse futures through CUIs can persuade us to critically shape our discourse on macro-scale concerns of the present, e.g., sustainability. We reflect on how conversational interactions with pluralistic, imagined futures can contribute to how being human stands to change.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

At the same time, we aimed through digital technologies to make the bowl unfamiliar, challenging expectations and assumed roles, however in such a way as not to overshadow its familiarity. This approach to defamiliarizing was with the intention of making it simultaneously familiar and strange, and therefore best open to reflection and analysis of the particularities of non-normative perceptions of humantechnology relations and qualities of experience. To support these aims and in keeping with a counterfactual artifact [41] and research product [23], we crafted the Tilting Bowl with a great deal of purpose and quality so it would fit with and be robust enough for everyday settings over time. Additionally, we drew on ideas of unawareness [22], and unselfconscious interaction [38] to guide the design in which the artifact required no human attention nor user interface to function, and the Tilting Bowl suggested more incremental engagements or intersections rather than explicit interaction.

However, talking about it, seeking medical help when necessary as well as examining oneself in order to 'know' oneself is complicated by social-cultural constructions of the vagina, i.e. it is something private, shameful and not to be talked about. In response to this, we designed Labella, an augmented system that supports intimate bodily knowledge and pelvic fitness in women. It combines a pair of underwear and a mobile phone as a tool for embodied intimate self-discovery. In this paper, we describe Labella, and its evaluation with fourteen women, aged 25-63. We show how through situated embodied perception Labella empowers 'looking'. We highlight how the simple act of augmented looking enables the construction of knowledge which ranges from establishing the 'very basics' through to a nuanced understanding of pelvic muscle structure. Finally, we highlight the role of awkwardness and humour in the design of interactions to overcome taboo.", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_title": "Lying Through One\u2019s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_para_1": "Nonetheless, literature shows that women have misconceptions about their intimate personal bodies [10], and this hidden part of the body (pelvic floor) is mostly learned about after the woman becomes a patient body, for instance during or after childbirth. As such, the preventative health practice of pelvic floor exercise is generally overlooked in women's health care and inhibited by a lack of body knowledge [35]. This lack of body knowledge can be thought of as intertwined with taboo, since these parts of the body are both hidden, and related to bodily fluids, bodily and sexual functioning [1]. We developed Labella as a tool for use by women, which provides a unique perspective on women's pelvic fitness. This incorporates learning about the biological (i.e. reproductive system), medical and personal health (i.e. incontinence), and positive health and wellbeing (i.e. sexual pleasure).", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics.

However, there has been relatively little research investigating the how changes in visual appearance or labelling affect VASs. In the 1970s Scott & Huskisson looked at how the graphical representation of paper-based VASs influenced the results of a pain severity questionnaire and found that a vertical orientation of the slider lead to more \"clumping\" than horizontal orientations [34] and that the presence of labels could attract responses [19]. Later, Dauphin et al. [28] performed a similar study and found the orientation of the scale affected the number of ratings at the end points. Performed at a small scale (~100 trials per condition), the visible effects were limited. In this paper we systematically explore the potential causes of bias in VASs on a large scale for digitally administered surveys.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_para_8": "The interview data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach [11], with the coding of the entire dataset undertaken by one researcher.

Due to the tablets\u2019 deterioration, scholars often rely on contextual cues to manually fill in missing parts in the text in a subjective and time-consuming process. We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods. Finally, we conduct human evaluations showing the applicability of our models in assisting experts to transcribe texts in extinct languages.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title":

task of masked language modeling, used ubiquitously in recent years for pretraining other downstream tasks (Peters et al., 2018;Howard and Ruder, 2018;Liu et al., 2019) lends itself directly to missing sign prediction in the transliterated texts. We experiment with various adaptations of BERT-based models (Devlin et al., 2019) trained and tested on Oracc, combined with a greedy decoding scheme to extend the prediction from single tokens to multiple words. We specifically focus on the effect multilingual pretraining has on downstream performance, which was recently shown beneficial for low-resource settings (Chau et al., 2020).", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_para_1": "A good deal of prior work has focused on testing for linguistic knowledge in language models (Rogers et al., 2020). Much of this work has prioritized testing syntax in pre-trained LMs via agreement tests (Linzen et al., 2016;Gulordava et al., 2018). Others expand to broader sets of syntactic phenomena (Wilcox et al., 2018;Futrell et al., 2019;Warstadt et al., 2020) and semantic/pragmatic phenomena (Ettinger, 2020). Other work has studied syntactic and semantic information in contextualized embeddings from these models (Hewitt and Manning, 2019;Tenney et al., 2018;Klafka and Ettinger, 2020). We take one step up from examination of these abstract linguistic capacities, with a focused examination of models' ability to use such linguistic scaffolding to process and retain new information described in text.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_0": "This method, which can be applied simply in a purely post-hoc analysis, independent of the training process, can enable both understanding of individual models and comparison across models. The interpretation process enables investigation of which identified functional groups correspond to linguistic or task level heuristics that may be employed in well understood non-neural methods for performing the task. Furthermore, it enables comparison across very different architectures in terms of the extent and the manner in which each architecture has approximated use of such knowledge. In so doing, the method can also be used to formulate explanations for differences in performance between models based on relevant linguistic or task knowledge that is identified as learned or not learned by the models. This approach builds on and extends prior work using linguistic and task knowledge to understand the behavior and the results of modern neural models (Shi et al., 2016b;Adi et al., 2016;Conneau et al., 2018).", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_7": "Previous work has demonstrated the connection between the distortion of the \u03a3\u039bM parameters and the intra-variability of human handwriting [14], which enables generation of realistic, human-like synthetic samples [28].

We believe these two types of research approaches are complementary: inventing general purpose visualization tools for existing black-box models on the one hand, and on the other, designing models like SoPa that are interpretable by construction."}}
