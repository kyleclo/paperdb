The tendency of humans to mirror each others behavior is an important social signal, used for showing affiliation and to guide the timing and tempo of social interaction. Intentionally increasing this kind of behavior has shown promise previously in improving social closeness and collaborative performance [5,10], and has been used in practice in the form of improvisational theatre and dance activities in workshops and therapy [1]. The game we have presented in this abstract is intended as a similar ice breaker activity for online communications. We intend to carry out research about the possible benefits playing SynchroMouse could have preceding cooperation, as well as whether play strategies and performance in the game can be used to predict the outcomes of such cooperative activities and the experience of team members. Additionally, since the task is released to the community as open source, we encourage others to use it and adapt it to their needs.", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_para_1": "The mirror game is a widely used paradigm for studying joint improvised actions between two people. Its use originates from the context of dance, theater and sports, but the paradigm has more recently also been adapted for use in research of social interaction [1]. In its simplest form the mirror game consists of two people facing each other and mirroring each other's hand gestures. In one of the versions of the paradigm, used in a variety of studies [3,4,8], a device is used for measuring both participant's hand motions, as they are playing the game together, facing each other. The device has one handle for each participant, and both handles can be moved parallel on identical straight tracks. Commonly, the task for the participants is to create improvised motion together. This paradigm has been used, for instance, to study movement richness and synchrony [3], the effect of cooperative roles, such as leader-follower versus joint improvisation, on movement synchrony [8], and the effect of improvisation experience on cooperation during the task [4].", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_abstract": "Joint improvised activity and synchrony of movement increases affiliation between people. The mirror game, where two people create joint motion in an improvised pattern, has been used to study different aspects of face-to-face collaboration and synchronization. To explore whether a similar game could be used to study computer-mediated interaction and as an ice-breaker activity to increase affiliation in remote collaboration, we developed a multiplayer online mouse coordination game inspired by the mirror game.

This is evidenced by activities such as dancing, playing music and marching. These kinds of activities can increase the sense of social cohesion within a group. Especially rhythmic, musical activity has been shown to increase social cohesion, cooperation and trust [6]. According to previous research, one key feature underlying this effect seems to be the interpersonal synchrony related to this type of activity. Specifically, synchronous behavior has been found to increase social ratings of affiliation [5] and closeness [9]. In addition to these types of findings, which are derived from subjective ratings, evidence suggests that synchronous activity can also enhance successful collaborative performance among pairs and groups. Performance in pair tasks that require detecting patterns and responding accordingly to the movements of the other person has been found to improve if preceded by synchronous movement [10]. Similarly, improvements have been found in group cooperation following synchronous movement and singing activities, compared to similar activities carried out asynchronously [11].",

Therefore, the velocity profile can have up to three primitives (each described with a lognormal), with one dominating the others in terms of amplitude. Moreover, when a user repeats the same rapid movement many times, some variability is expected and observed, although each individual trajectory still has a dominant primitive as long as there is no trembling or hesitation.

Stroke gestures represent fast movements produced by one or more fingers in contact with a touch-sensitive surface that reports a temporal sequence of {x, y} coordinates mapped to a specific action in the user interface [26]. Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27]. As touch interfaces become even more ubiquitous, it is crucial to provide equal access for people with all abilities, such as people with visual impairments, who face considerable challenges interacting with touchscreens that expose interfaces almost exclusively designed for visual input [7,22,23,44].", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_13": "Interesting future work directions may look at the applicability of synthesizing data across user populations for mouse input [15,17,33], voice input [21,29], whole-body movement [53,62,63], and even EEG input [25,56]. While all these directions are definitely interesting, they are nevertheless challenging, but worth exploring in order to advance our theoretical and practical knowledge of simulating input data across different user populations toward better interface designs for users will all abilities. Looking forward, we believe that our work already forms a good demonstration of how simulation can be used to refine the gesture design process within HCI and accessibility research and we are eager to see how the community will pick up these ideas and use them for other application areas.

[23] showed that blind people prefer gestures that use an edge or a corner of the device and Buzzi et al.

Detailed examination of gesture articulation paths [23] showed that blind people produce touch gestures that are different in size, speed, number of strokes, and gesture shape than the gestures produced by sighted people.

To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants.

This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation.

We also interviewed seven sighted individuals to explore their thoughts on authoring alt text for profile pictures. Our findings suggest that detailed image descriptions and user narrated alt text can provide screen reader users enjoyable and informative experiences when exploring profile pictures. We also identified mismatches between how sighted individuals would author alt text with what screen reader users prefer to know about profile pictures.

This presents an opportunity to understand what is missing in COVID-prompted digital transformation, and to consider how to support SMBs on their journey to becoming digitally empowered. We propose that doing so should involve taking into account the fundamental bedrock on which business is conducted for SMBs in Kenya, socio-tecture. For example, data was rarely part of this initial digital transformation, except as a beneficial by product. However, as discussed in the literature, data is becoming increasingly important for business in the modern world [27,28]. We agree with Lopez, Segura and Sant\u00f3rum [34] on the need for solutions accessible to SMBs, taking into account their limited resources, but crucially we add on the importance of taking socio-tecture into account, even, or perhaps especially, when thinking of data-driven business for SMBs. There is a tendency for the personal and social to be designed out, as we move to data-driven business [68] and we saw this here (e.g. RP07 (MB, trade logistics), RP06 (VSB, financier)). However, research has pointed to the importance of designing for rather than designing out relationships in settings such as crowdsourcing [69] and fintech [68,70,71]. A related example is the importance of intermediaries in technology use and adoption, for users rather different from ours [72][73][74][75]. Designing for socio-tecture extends this concern and elaborates a framework or lens through which we can more systematically conceive of these features in business, i.e., a heavy reliance on networks, relational over transactional, and people as knowledge. Taking into account socio-tecture, raises questions such as how do we create algorithms and data-driven businesses which enhance and value the social instead of removing it?", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_7": "Following up on the call of Zimmerman, this work will therefore extend the recent, but still relatively modest body of work that addresses the use of DIY assistive technology in a school setting [34,38], also including how the larger socio-cultural environment contributes to its potential for empowerment.

Colbert et al. [13] noted that \"digital fluency\" (a level of proficiency with digital technology that allows someone to achieve strategic goals) is a core competency of the modern workforce, and that technology has blurred the lines between work and nonwork domains. Jarrahi [32], Hemsley [29], Lee [40], and others have documented the processes and communications of \"digital nomads\" -people who are geographically mobile and work remotely, and who have formed online communities to network and share information. Sutherland and Jarrahi note their similarity of digital nomads' knowledge networks and cobbled-together tech and social practices to those of gig workers for ride-sharing apps or odd-job marketplaces [59]. Sawyer [56], Erickson and Jarrahi [17] describe the layers of both technical and social knowledge that modern workers must draw on as \"infrastructural competence,\" a form of bricolage [43] in which people apply any resources at hand in their given work conditions or contexts toward the desired goals.", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_para_9": "Secondly, the pandemic reveals the extent to which digital transformation for SMBs is social and collective. We can understand the pandemic as acting as a 'breaching experiment' [76,77], which enables us to see facets of a phenomenon otherwise hidden. COVID-19 pushed the whole ecosystem into digital transformation together, creating the social, cultural and economic conditions in which digitisation could occur. This is unlikely to be recreated in normal times. Certainly, the ecosystem can promote digital transformation -as larger more powerful organisations encourage (or force) others in their ecosystem to change. This has been seen elsewhere, in particular through the disruption that large platforms have caused to traditional industries such as taxis and autorickshaws [78,79]. Such disruptions by big players may have mixed benefits, often coming with a hefty dose of negative consequences for the smaller actors within them, such as the drivers [78,[80][81][82][83]. By contrast, in our data these transformations appeared more benign, often being done in partnership with the customers who end up being digitised. It is likely that this is due to the importance of socio-tecture in the ecosystem combined with the conditions in which transformation took place. That is, in this case the digitisation was done to sustain relationships between the bigger and smaller players given the pandemic. Thus, unlike many platform economies, the interventions were locally designed with relationships in mind. These interventions either enabled interpersonal interaction, for example, RP38's (SB, engineering) augmented reality glasses enabling the engineer and customer to troubleshoot together, or where interactions were not supported by the available technology, interactions around the technology were designed into the workflow, e.g. RP07 (MB, trade logistics)) created a customer ordering platform and gave each customer a tablet for ordering but also each customer had a dedicated sales agent regularly checking in. Notably, the ecosystem is just as likely to act as a barrier to digital transformation outside of these exceptional circumstances, especially for SMBs, given that even the SMBs in our study who prompted ecosystem digital transformation were part of larger conglomerates, with their own IT department, and so in this aspect acted more like larger enterprises. When thinking of digital transformation, more broadly, whether within or outside of the pandemic it is important to take an ecosystem perspective.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_9": "Before we engage in the theoretical discussion on the three political discourse theories, we need to point out the important conceptual distinction between reaction mechanisms as technical features of a platform and platform affordances as relational, community-specific behaviors that result from interacting with reaction mechanisms in a nondeterministic manner [26,45,118]. The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_15": "Such tendencies can be seen as a trend towards \"magical thinking\" regarding technology and institutional systems, which can be seen as a historical pattern. Larry Cuba pointed out that this tendency has a political aspect that goes beyond social factors and triggers political motivations [30]. These concepts bear resemblance to the concept of the \"sociotechnical imaginary\" that is broadly used in the field of social technology. Sociotechnical imaginaries are generally futureoriented visions of connected social and technological orders operated by key individuals and institutions [64]. Although scholars have noted that sociotechnical imaginaries can identify paths and actions for effective innovations, they caution that disparate imaginaries can bring very different programs and policies to society [64,108]. Our study also contributes to this growing area of literature on the relationship between decision-makers' power and techno-scientific innovations. As social computing and HCI4D researchers, we want to raise the possibility of positions and initiatives that address this techno-focused solutionism among decision-makers so as to resolve the contradictory vision between innovation and sustainability. Indeed, such tech obsession has already been reported in the CSCW and HCI4D literature (for example, see [83]), and various critical and speculative design interventions and ethnographic studies have been done in the HCI literature to counter such utopian thinking [10,36,97,106]. However, little has been done to operationalize this criticism in practice that can significantly impact policymaking. Moreover, a deliberate effort towards affordable (in both financial and human resource) technology design is required, using existing platforms to capture community voices in ways such as using participatory media to invite marginalized voices and to share with decision-makers to inform programs and policies. Such efforts should consider designing systems according to both high-level and bottom-up needs and capabilities. Additionally, as suggested by our findings, instead of building more social-mediastyle platforms, un-platforming innovations that leverage existing social media channels offer an alternative route to engagement. Un-platformed design is a conceptualization of coordinated participation in social media technologies, [71]. This study provides three exemplar projects in participatory health research, connective online learning, and strategic future foresight through the configuration of accessible and well-known social media apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook that act as clear examples of how this could be used. We also emphasize to social computing and HCI4D researchers that by building on existing platforms, practitioners could avoid the pitfalls of developing expensive bespoke solutions that may or may not work.", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_abstract": "Small and Medium sized Businesses (SMBs) make up majority of employment in Africa (around 80%).

Research has evidenced that the COVID-19 pandemic was not only a health crisis, but also prompted widespread technological disruption [7]. This phenomenon was reflected in our research through the widespread digital transformation of SMBs. However, the majority of the technologies adopted were not designed with the African business in mind. Rather they were designed in and for the Global North. Research shows that just porting such technologies from one setting -with its specific orientations and concerns -to another setting is not always effective nor beneficial [8][9][10][11].

From earlier research on the use of and barriers to DIY technologies, we already learned about the challenges with respect to efort expectancy and the lack of facilitating conditions [77], the lack of alignment with clinical practice [37], the time-consuming process of confguration and adding content due to openness of DIY toolkits [52], and the lack of representation of end-users in the design [11], resulting in design for others [56]. Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_8": "While a significant amount of collaborative practice around design in HCI orientates itself towards enabling conditions where participants can be open-minded [15], withhold judgement [56] and imagine radically different futures [14], in many respects the opposite issue is the matter of concern here. The challenge was to shape requesters\u00d5 ideas in ways to fit their imaginations to the capabilities of simple bots. It is often claimed that digital technologies can be \u00d2black boxes\u00d3 that are \u00d4impermeable, inflexible, and unviewable\u00d5 [37]. Indeed, consumer products are critiqued for creating conditions where these hidden innards disable people from appropriating, re-making and engaging in their own practices of design [53]. Therefore, we might take inspiration from attempts to support DIY practices around maker technologies and kits for experimentation with input and output platforms [53]. Simple tools that provide exemplar functions and types of data that act as bot \u00d2building blocks\u00d3 might offer a starting point for guided experimentation. One way of doing so might be to present already existing and typical designs that require completing (as suggested by [44]) through adding or taking away component blocks that represent specific functionality. In doing so, we might more carefully scaffold learning through safe experimentation, and also extend the current positive examples we saw where exemplar bots would be used as a starting point to inspire or ideate a new bot creation by more novice users.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_10": "5.1.1 Understanding technology in the context of interdependence between individuals, the organisation, and the wider community. Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]). However, this individualistic perspective overlooks how students, teachers and therapists are afected by the organisations within which they operate, and which in turn are impacted on a societal level, thereby risking to undermine ongoing processes of empowerment.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_11": "Critical awareness of the socio-political environment. The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59].

The nuanced signals picked up along the way, transformed us and weakened our temptation for solutionist reasoning. Instead, the research turned out to be humbling, realising certain challenges are not to be resolved through technology alone. In the course of our analysis, this research also transformed us in to activists, recognizing how the structural underfunding refects social injustice and in fact can be regarded as structural violence against children with disabilities [28]. Because of the underfunding, at times, even basic services could not always be met (e.g., the bus service). During the course of this research, several articles appeared in popular press echoing the fndings in this school and across other nations.

The first emphasises the issues that arise from implementations which are disconnected from the social, cultural, and physical attributes that are unique to the African context. The second suggests HCI methods that incorporate indigenous concepts in order to make research outputs relevant to end users [57]. In this regard, HCI has been examined through the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu and its philosophical underpinnings have been used as a structural basis which grants situated orientation [58] and provides a relevant framework for design innovation, technology use, its adoption, and how it can drive business innovation in Africa. In recent years, HCI has gained traction in Africa with a strong emphasis on opportunities availed by mobile technologies and increased access to internet and affordability of devices. This has led to great emphasis on design and deployment of usercentered digital solutions that are enmeshed with the needs of an African audience to solve African problems. Building on this work, this paper thus situates itself not in a development discourse -where the researcher designs from an assumption that the non-western community is in need of development and would unquestionably benefit from western technologies [8] -but instead from an afro-centric discourse where knowledge and innovation from the continent is legitimate and equal to others, and can spark innovation and problem-solving in similar contexts on and off the continent.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_5": "The complex multi-sectoral nature of high-level decision making and the institutions that form these decision networks can be further understood through the concept of institutioning.

These scenarios are characterized as situations in which the process is constantly moving horizontally and vertically between and within diverse micro-meso and macro levels [58] and call for attention to the significant relationships between policy, institutions, and meta-cultural frames [58,115]. PD approaches in social computing are figured by a diverse group of institutions, and need to be understood in terms of the meso-and macro-level institutions that PD is dependent on and informed by [58]. Dearden and colleagues [33] also acknowledged the need to understand the institutioning involved in critical computing issues. In the debate on HCI and social innovation, they also contribute to the insufficiently studied issue of HCI designers' lack of attention past the research context to how innovations become distributed and adopted for social goods. Political issues surrounding technology, such as how decisions are made for technology adoption and scale-up in programs may be understood through the complexities of institutioning and the actors at the decision-making level [114,115], where these institutions and their individuals are broadly influenced by their own objectives and priorities, yet have to translate initiatives between designers and communities [25,26].", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_para_0": "impacted economic activity in many sectors.

Further, there is little well-articulated literature on the high-level political contexts and actors in Global South countries, such as the political visions and priorities influencing and driving Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) programs and how projects and policies change as they go through central authorities (from the government to national and international organizations) [124].", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_para_1": "At least half of the manifestos express concerns about sustainability in IoT returning us to the question of progress both in the manifestos and in HCI. Environmental sustainability is a major concern for HCI tied to technological interventions [10]. Within sustainable HCI technology design and development is implicated in an impulse to create change [16]. Much of this research has turned problems of environmental action into questions of personal moral choice, often focusing on behavior change as a route to altering individual consumption patterns [10]. An alternative path has focused on 'ecologies of practices' within design and HCI [8,27]. In the manifestos the latter approach to sustainability is more apparent. Just a few documents imagine how IoT could be used to change, augment or improve individual behavior (Kr\u00fcger, RIOT; Smit, RIOT). We identify three main notions of sustainability in the manifestos: realigning lifetimes of the physical and the digital, obsolescence and locality.

Part of this effort has focused on the development of applications of theoretical concepts by distilling principles [30], frameworks [15] and methodologies [5] with the aim of having a direct impact on practice. These tools, such as the principles of reflective design developed by Sengers et al.

In fact, the reasons and contexts for reciprocated smartphone use can be quite similar to those of initial self-initiated smartphone use (e.g., disengagement).

To address this gap, we take the case of Bangladesh as a typical Global South context in which development work is carried out by a complex intertwined network of stakeholders across governments, NGOs, donors, and industries. To better understand the current development landscape and its priorities for digital technologies, we conducted interviews with 14 influential decision-makers in Bangladesh who play significant roles in the development of nutrition strategies. Our findings highlight a disconnect between the Bangladesh government's \"digital mandate\" and the reality of digital innovation practice within the nutrition development sector.

We suggest understanding the factors that guide the decision-making process of digital innovation practices in terms of four dimensions: internal, external, vertical, and horizontal. Consequently, we recommend CSCW and HCI researchers become mediators to connect decision-makers and communities and bring their voices in ICT innovations for global development.

Second, it focuses on understanding global content organization structures with the main event at the center, while the existing tasks focus on either understanding rhetorical aspects of discourse structures (RST and PDTB discourse parsing) or detecting shallow topic transition structures (text segmentation).", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_para_1": "Genre-specific functional structures have been studied based on different attributes, but mostly for genres other than news articles.

This paper proposes a new multi-axis modeling to better capture the temporal structure of events. In addition, we identify that event end-points are a major source of confusion in annotation, so we also propose to annotate TempRels based on start-points only. A pilot expert annotation effort using the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in IAA from the conventional 60\u2019s to 80\u2019s (Cohen\u2019s Kappa). This better-defined annotation scheme further enables the use of crowdsourcing to alleviate the labor intensity for each annotator.

And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks. In the future, more data can be collected and used with advanced techniques such as ILP (Do et al., 2012), structured learning (Ning et al., 2017) or multi-sieve .

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_metadata": "Authors: Yechun Tang, Xiaoxia Cheng, Weiming Lu | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2022 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_metadata": "Authors: Ga\u00ebl Guibon, Matthieu Labeau, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flamein, Luce Lefeuvre, C.

Developing the corresponding set of labels was a cyclical rather than a linear process. After critical engagement with the cited literature on the three political discourse theories, two co-authors separately developed codes based on their analysis of the most essential components of each political discourse theory. Then, they compared the created categories and, with the aid of a third co-author, agreed on an initial set of components. Through multiple rounds of discussion, two co-authors assigned the essential components to each of the three discourse theories. This process led to further discussion on the definitional scope of the components. Thus, through multiple rounds of discussion between three co-authors, going back and forth between the choices of essential components and their assignment to the three discourse theories, we finally agreed on thirteen essential components that could be operationalized in a multilabel classification task (see final set of components together with their definitions in Appendix B & Table 5). We document disagreement among co-authors on the definition and assignment of some of the components in Appendix B (see Fact-related argument in Appendix B.3 and Identity Labels in Appendix B.8). Table 1 presents an overview of the essential components and how we assigned them to each political discourse theory for our multilabel classification task.", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_metadata": "Authors: S.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_metadata": "Authors: Haejun Lee, Drew A.

Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing, but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs, we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback.

While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

SideSwipe [35] also leverages the unmodified global system for mobile communication (GSM) signal to enable in-air hand gestures above and at the side of a mobile device. Arefin Shimon et. al., [1] explored hand gestures above a smartwatch in order to overcome the limited interaction space of the small screen.

Also, TouchID [23] led to novel and expressive tabletop interaction techniques by identifying which hand and which part of the hand was touching the surface, as well as what posture and what gesture was being enacted with the fiduciarytagged glove. Similarly, Finger-Aware Shortcuts [36] employed finger, hand, and posture identification for keyboards to provide shortcut availability and expressivity. In this system, a key press can have multiple command mappings depending on which fingers and postures were used to press a key. Jackson et. al. [15] also extend multi-touch interfaces by using a combination of multi-touch gestures and 3D movements of the hand(s) above the surface. Furthermore, Kim et al. [18] and Song et al. [27] augmented touch events on mobile devices with finger gestures by using both hands. One hand controls a touch device, while the other hand performs gestures as an additional input. Conversely, Hinckley et. al. [13] explored interaction techniques with one hand for hand-held devices that leverage the combination of touch and motion, suggesting hybrid touch+motion gestures. In addition, Expressy [33], using only one hand, employed the movement of the wrist to add expressiveness to touch-based interactions. Air+Touch [5] focused on in-air gestures performed only with the thumb to enhance touch interaction while the same hand grasped the phone.

We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_8": "Many passive acoustic approaches have been employed to detect gestures [12,20,21,52] and localize signals [17,24,36,37,48,49].

This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation.

Finegrained analyses of users' gesture articulations are also possible to understand how users vary their gestures relative to each other and relative to recognizers' canonical template forms [65,66]. Also, gesture recognition algorithms have been using many gesture features, such as path length, articulation time, or average speed [8,52], that can be repurposed as gesture performance measures to evaluate users' gesture articulations [51,68]. However, most of these measures, although useful for gesture classification, lack descriptive power for gesture analysis because they focus on the global characteristics of a gesture as a whole. In contrast, the Gesture RElative Accuracy Toolkit (GREAT) [65], which we employ in this work, enables access to fine-grained measurements on the gesture path that reveal and help understand the subtleties of users' gesture articulations. More specifically, the GREAT measures describe the many ways in which gestures unfold in time, space, stroke structure, and appearance, characterizing gesture articulations in terms of their closeness to a reference form, analogous to MacKenzie et al.'s accuracy measures for pointing tasks [31].", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_para_1": "Some eyes-free input methods for smartwatches have been proposed [15,3,4,16].

We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

Benefiting from designing various effective self-supervised learning objectives, such as masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2018), PLMs can effectively capture the syntax and semantics in text to generate informative language representations for downstream NLP tasks.

To address this issue, some recent studies attempt to improve PLMs to better understand relations between entities (Soares et al., Peng et al., 2020).

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_para_3": "In focusing on models' ability to extract, retain, and deploy information conveyed in text, our work also relates to tasks in reading comprehension question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2018;Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al., 2018;Mostafazadeh et al., 2017;Yang et al., 2018;Richardson et al., 2013).

The efficiency of pre-training has been explored by previous work. Some works (Gong et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020;Gu et al., 2021) propose progressive learning to accelerate the pre-training, which are motivated by the fact that different layers have some similar knowledge (e.g., attention patterns). They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) proposes a task of replaced token detection to predict whether each token in the input was replaced or not, which improves the pre-training efficiency. Our method is orthogonal to this kind of work and the combination of ELECTRA and bert2BERT could achieve better efficiency.

We investigate whether findings in oral code-switching concerning content and style, as well as speaker proficiency, are carried over into written code-switching in discussion forums.

Two coders labelled 4,500 unique comments with at least one of the thirteen types of essential components extracted from our theoretical analysis (see label development documentation in Section 3.4 and Appendix B). To ensure intercoder reliability and the representativeness of the sample, we performed the following procedures. First, coders discussed the developed minimal theoretic conceptualization, reviewed predefined examples for each class, and resolved any questions about the nature of the classes. Then, both coders labelled the same set of 100 random comments from the corpus, yielding a Krippendorf alpha of 0.7. After discussing prevailing differences in the coding tactics, coders learned to adjust their coding in a way that conformed more to the theoretic framework. Coders then relabelled the same corpus, yielding an intercoder reliability of 0.75. This was higher than the expected minimum for coding complicated language tasks in the literature (>0.6 -see e.g., [5,37,43,92,105,122]). Since coders' labeling practices were robust, they proceeded with the selection and labeling of further comments. Specifically, an initial sample of 1650 comments was labeled, containing 30 comments from each subreddit in the dataset. Next, a second batch of 1000 comments was annotated, which we randomly selected by stratified sampling among subreddits. To assess how many comments were necessary for an accurate classifier, we trained a preliminary language model on these 2750 comments, finding that for reliable prediction for each class, at least 300 observations were necessary. To satisfy this condition, we continued labeling comments by stratified random sampling until an annotated sample of 4500 comments was produced.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_metadata": "Authors: Arjun Reddy Akula, Spandana Gella, Keze Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Siva Reddy | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_20": "To further control for other factors that could plausibly affect the outcome, we again used the Wayback Machine [8] to extract different moderation rules that existed in each subreddit during the investigated period. Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116]. Besides these moderation rules, we also use the \"nest level\" of a comment as a control. The nest level quantifies how deep a comment appeared in a specific discussion.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_metadata": "Authors: Wei-Jen Ko, Ahmed El-Kishky, Adithya Renduchintala, Vishrav Chaudhary, Naman Goyal, Francisco Guzm\u00e1n, Pascale Fung, Philipp Koehn, Mona T.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28].

In this paper, we propose a joint contrastive learning (JointCL) framework, which consists of stance contrastive learning and target-aware prototypical graph contrastive learning. Specifically, a stance contrastive learning strategy is employed to better generalize stance features for unseen targets. Further, we build a prototypical graph for each instance to learn the target-based representation, in which the prototypes are deployed as a bridge to share the graph structures between the known targets and the unseen ones. Then a novel target-aware prototypical graph contrastive learning strategy is devised to generalize the reasoning ability of target-based stance representations to the unseen targets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ZSSD task.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_2": "Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stance for destination unseen targets by learning stance features from known targets (Allaway and McKeown, 2020).

Based on it, they proposed a topic-grouped attention model to implicitly capture relationships between targets by using generalized topic representations. Allaway et al.

This verifies the effectiveness of our JointCL framework in the ZSSD task. Furthermore, the significance tests of JointCL over the baseline models show that our JointCL significantly outperforms the baseline models (the results of p\u2212value on most of the evaluation metrics are less than 0.05). More concretely, in comparison with the adversarial learning-based model (TOAD), our JointCL achieves significant improvement across all datasets.

As such, the system can learn to process both languages. In one work, Currey and Heafield (2019) improved zero-shot translation using monolingual data on the pivot language. However, in our scenario, there is no parallel data between the low-resource language and any other language. In other work, Arivazhagan et al.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_6": "Attention models have shown great promise in several applications, including machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014) and image caption generation (Xu et al., 2015).

We develop a novel smooth version of the multi-focus attention function, which generalizes the single focus softmax-function. While some existing entity resolution systems (Jin et al., 2014;Lazic et al., 2015) may be viewed as having attention mechanisms, these are intended for single textual features and not readily extensible to structured inference. 6 Experiments 6.1 Evaluation data CoNLL: The CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) contains 1393 articles with about 34K mentions, and the standard performance metric is mention-averaged accuracy.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4.

Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_19": "The CFA's results reveal that there is a clear connection between theory and social media discussions, and also show which key rhetoric components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse describe user interactions in our sample (RQ1). Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_abstract": "A significant share of political discourse occurs online on social media platforms. Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all.

To this end, we analyze an extensive dataset of political discussions on Reddit against the theoretical framework of three prominent political discourse theories: deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse.

Cheng et al. [31] found that a higher number of downvotes across multiple social media platforms resulted in worsening the quality of discourse, while a higher count of positive reactions did not improve discourse significantly. Warut Khern-am-nuai et al. [71] showed that after removing downvoting in a popular public forum, the number of both posts and replies significantly increased. Furthermore they found a decrease in toxicity and an increase in the diversity of replies. Shmargad et al. [109] demonstrated that upvoting incivility incentivized users to generate more toxic content. In a field experiment, Matias et al. [81,88] showed that hiding downvotes increased the percentage of commenters who had not been vocal on political subreddits before. On Twitter, Adelani et al. [1] demonstrated that user feedback expressed as likes and retweets significantly affected topic continuation in discussions. Stroud et al. [114] concluded that the type of feedback that users gave by pressing a button (recommend, like, respect) altered the frequency and the scope of its use (see also [115]). Focusing on Reddit, Graham et al. [53] found that indeed users rarely use the voting reaction mechanisms as community guidelines dictate. Generalizing, Hayes et al. [61] found that users interpreted and applied the same reaction mechanism differently, depending on system, social, and structural factors.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact. Thus, in our study, we refer to upvoting and downvoting as reaction mechanisms because we do not explore how specific online communities and cultures differ in the perception, use, and interactions with such reaction mechanisms.", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_7": "In addition to the direct impact of reaction mechanisms on social media discourse, reaction mechanism designs may have additional indirect consequences since user reactions are often used as signals in training data for recommendation algorithms, such as those used to order news feeds.

Such feedback does not always represent explicit user preferences about content, but rather is used as a way to overcome training issues of recommender systems. It is also useful for suggesting content that will keep users engaged, regardless of potential \"spill over effects\", i.e., users externalizing further unforeseen behaviors.

Social media platforms are not simply digital representations of offline political activity. They are key spaces for articulation, organization, and implementation of political action [27]. Indeed, they are not intermediaries of communication processes, but function as their curators [51]. When billions of people interact in a common space, a platform's design has enormous power over the production, mediation, and dissemination of user discussions. A platform's choice of communication reaction mechanisms (i.e., \"likes,\" \"upvotes/downvotes\" etc.) and its recommendation algorithms critically influence the nature of user interactions on the platform. On the one hand, such reaction mechanisms -as means of evaluation -condition what type of information users produce, and, on the other hand, recommendation algorithms determine what information users will come to interact with [23,76,90,93].", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_20": "To further control for other factors that could plausibly affect the outcome, we again used the Wayback Machine [8] to extract different moderation rules that existed in each subreddit during the investigated period. Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116].

A substantial quantitative research tradition has asked what factors come together for a collective action such as a decision or political action to occur or be successful [60,16]. When explaining a protest or strike, political opportunity theories would focus on the nature of the grievances of movement actors, expecting that those with greater grievances would be more likely to take action [55]. Political opportunity theories would also emphasize network relations among movement actors as important factors in joining a social movement [52]. Resource mobilization theories would focus on group resources as important factors in social movement mobilization, as well as the relative isolation of a group from other participating social movement groups [53].", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_4": "Our study builds on and significantly extends research studies that have performed first steps towards understanding social media users' political rhetoric.

They described deliberation as the presence of reasoned and respectful discussions and civic agency as the ability to interact and participate in the public sphere. Both Friess et al. [48] and Wright et al. [127] developed coding schemes for labeling user content as deliberative based on features such as rationality and constructiveness. Guimaraes et al.

Then, they compared the created categories and, with the aid of a third co-author, agreed on an initial set of components. Through multiple rounds of discussion, two co-authors assigned the essential components to each of the three discourse theories. This process led to further discussion on the definitional scope of the components. Thus, through multiple rounds of discussion between three co-authors, going back and forth between the choices of essential components and their assignment to the three discourse theories, we finally agreed on thirteen essential components that could be operationalized in a multilabel classification task (see final set of components together with their definitions in Appendix B & Table 5). We document disagreement among co-authors on the definition and assignment of some of the components in Appendix B (see Fact-related argument in Appendix B.3 and Identity Labels in Appendix B.8).

We kept capitalization and punctuation of comments in their original form and removed the quoted content in the case that a user was quoting another user. To train our model, we used the large language model XLnet [129]. XLnet is an architecture that combines transformers and auto-regressive modeling. We selected XLnet over other commonly used language models such as BERT [39] because it still holds the top performance in multiple text classification benchmarks (e.g., first place in Amazon-5, Amazon-2, DBpedia, Yelp-2, AG News, second place in IMDb, Yelp-5) [126]. We applied a warm-up initialization of 0.1, a learning rate of 3e-5, and a maximum sequence length of 100 words. Our final model resulted in a label ranking average precision score of 91%, while all class specific F1 scores were higher than 0.87. To ensure the robustness of our model, we additionally created an evaluation set of 200 comments, in which each class of the dataset appeared at least ten times. On the evaluation set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.72, label ranking average precision score of 0.85, while all class specific F-1 scores were higher than 0.76 ( Figure 2). Given the obtained model accuracy, we then analyzed a total of 155 million comments in our corpus. To understand to what extent the essential components of deliberation, civic discourse, and demagoguery characterize social media discussions, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA is generally used to test hypotheses about plausible model structures [21], and has commonly been used to model different types of data, from survey information to time-series [22]. Until now, the application of CFA in NLP-driven questions has been limited (e.g., [96]), and our study serves as an inspiration for exploiting its capabilities, but also understanding its limits in machine-learning based research. Factor analysis allowed us to mathematically represent the political theories as latent unobserved variables (factors) as described by a set of observed variables (items). The observed variables corresponded to the different rhetoric components as predicted by the language model. We chose CFA rather than exploratory factor analysis (EFA) since we were investigating whether a specific conceptualization of discourse theories empirically characterized social media discussions, and not which general argument structures were best described by our data. With CFA, we could construct structures of variables that complied with the minimal conceptualizations of political theories and by assessing the quality of model-fit, we explored to what extent political theories can describe how users discuss political topics on Reddit.

Two coders labelled 4,500 unique comments with at least one of the thirteen types of essential components extracted from our theoretical analysis (see label development documentation in Section 3.4 and Appendix B). To ensure intercoder reliability and the representativeness of the sample, we performed the following procedures. First, coders discussed the developed minimal theoretic conceptualization, reviewed predefined examples for each class, and resolved any questions about the nature of the classes. Then, both coders labelled the same set of 100 random comments from the corpus, yielding a Krippendorf alpha of 0.7. After discussing prevailing differences in the coding tactics, coders learned to adjust their coding in a way that conformed more to the theoretic framework. Coders then relabelled the same corpus, yielding an intercoder reliability of 0.75. This was higher than the expected minimum for coding complicated language tasks in the literature (>0.6 -see e.g., [5,37,43,92,105,122]). Since coders' labeling practices were robust, they proceeded with the selection and labeling of further comments. Specifically, an initial sample of 1650 comments was labeled, containing 30 comments from each subreddit in the dataset. Next, a second batch of 1000 comments was annotated, which we randomly selected by stratified sampling among subreddits. To assess how many comments were necessary for an accurate classifier, we trained a preliminary language model on these 2750 comments, finding that for reliable prediction for each class, at least 300 observations were necessary. To satisfy this condition, we continued labeling comments by stratified random sampling until an annotated sample of 4500 comments was produced.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_2": "The clearest theorization of attitudes as positions in an argumentative space is due to the discursive psychologist Michael Billig, according to whom culture ofers a set of shared and accepted commonplaces [3] both in favor and against a given controversial behavior [3].

Civic engagement interactions aim to be inclusive -a key goal of civic engagement movements [89]. Deliberation, from a Habermasian perspective, requires intersubjective propositional knowledge between conversation members [20]. That is, knowledge-claims must fulfill standards of intersubjectivity: ideally, all discussants are able to relate to the beliefs that underlie a proposition. Propositions must be grounded in logical plausibility, factual correctness, and communal narratives. Discussants' claims must have pragmatic value (i.e, \"propositionality\") in order to support the group's goal of reaching an understanding.

Engaging with the literature on demagogic and civic discourse revealed identity labels to be relevant for these two types of discourse but not deliberative discourse (for demagogic discourse, see [57,63,102]; for civic discourse, see [2,24,60]). However, conceptualizing different identity references for demagogic and civic discourse proved to be challenging and authors disagreed on how to define identity labels for demagoguery and civic engagement. Out of all three political discourse theories, civic engagement is the most contested one. It allows for the most diverse definitions of what it's essential components are (e.g., compare [40] and [24]). We first agreed on a basic identity label to identify comments that expressed the existence of collective or group (i.e., collective rhetoric). One author then proposed an identity label to highlight group differences, a feature of both demagogic and civic discourse [35,60,63]. This label was called \"we vs. them\" to underline the competitive nature of interaction in both demagoguery and civic engagement. In demagogic discourse, members often degrade another group to establish a sense of unity. Here, a unity is formed around group characteristics and people that appear to best embody such characteristics. In short, narratives of unity are not formed around a serious discussion around policy-making to bring about political change but around important personas. This, one author pointed out could be a decisive conceptual distinction between identity in demagoguery and civic discourse. To account for the lack of engagement with policy-making topics to establish a sense of unity (as is the case for civic engagement), we finally agreed on two more identity labels for demagogic discourse: \"you in the epicenter\" and \"who instead of what. \" The first label highlights the importance of a group and why it should be treated preferentially while the second appeals to the characteristics of in-group or out-group members. In civic discourse, we added the labels \"empathy/reciprocity, \" \"counterargument\", and \"situational call to action\" that, together with \"we vs. them, \" would sample comments that expressed a sense of unity but that at the same time featured constructive and productive interactions on specific policy-making goals.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_3": "Although many subreddit participants supported the blackout, the demands made in the blackout were focused entirely on the distinct interests of subreddit moderators, leaders of the site's communities.

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3).

Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources.

It can also help to augment the question set to enhance the performance of question answering systems. Current QG systems mainly follow the sequenceto-sequence structure with an encoder for modeling the textual input and a decoder for text generation (Du et al., 2017). These neural-based models have shown promising performance, however, they suffer from generating irrelevant and uninformative questions. Figure 1a presents two sample questions generated by a nueral QG model. Q2 contains irrelevant information \"Everton Fc\".

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question.

And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks. In the future, more data can be collected and used with advanced techniques such as ILP (Do et al., 2012), structured learning (Ning et al., 2017) or multi-sieve .

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_para_4": "Knowledge base construction Previous work has looked at constructing knowledge bases as relational schemas using expert knowledge (Lenat, 1995;Bodenreider, 2004;Miller, 1995), semistructured text extraction (Suchanek et al., 2007;Hoffart et al., 2013;Auer et al., 2007;Bollacker et al., 2008) and unstructured text extraction (Dong et al., 2014;Carlson et al., 2010;Nakashole et al., 2011Nakashole et al., , 2012Niu, 2012).

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_metadata": "Authors: Ran Zmigrod, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Year: 2021 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Conference", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_metadata": "Authors: Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, N.

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis. We adopt a sensor fusion approach by taking both 'surface waves' (i.e., vibrations through surface) and 'sound waves' (i.e., vibrations through air) into analysis to improve sensing resolution. We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_9": "The TDOA approach. For localizing the acoustic signal, the most prevalent approach, which we also use in this work, is time difference of arrival (TDOA) analysis [10,24,36,37,48,49]. For example, PingPongPlus [24] instruments four contact microphones located at the outermost corners of the desired interactive region. When a Ping-Pong ball falls inside of this region, the signal arrives to the four sensors at different times, enabling a hyperbolic intersection localization. Likewise, SurfaceVibe [36] also uses four geophones in a similar setup to enable two interaction types, tap and swipe, on multiple types of surfaces. Instead of instrumenting the surfaces, Toffee [48] augments the mobile devices and laptops with four piezo sensors and demonstrates accurate resolution of the bearings of touch events around the devices, although the evaluation considers only a single user. Besides TDOA analysis, SoundCraft [17] instead uses a target signal subspace method, by adopting the basic idea of Multiple Signal Classification technique, which can localize acoustic signals even in noisy environment.", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_para_8": "Many passive acoustic approaches have been employed to detect gestures [12,20,21,52] and localize signals [17,24,36,37,48,49].

Populating the equations with these numbers, we get the differences of two TDOAs along X axis and Y axis as 25.8\u00b5s and 3.6\u00b5s respectively.

We collected data continuously from each IMU sensor board at a sampling rate of 50Hz for all Touch+Finger gestures ( Figure  2). Since secondary gestures, i.e. hand poses and in-air gestures, take about 0.4s to 0.9s to perform, a one-second sliding window was used for performing statistical feature extraction. Inspired by [31], we calculated four statistical features from the sliding window: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. The same calculation was performed for each sensor value, i.e. three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope, pitch, and roll. The yaw value was excluded due to its unreliability and a calibration issue [33]. In general, roll and pitch are important for recognizing hand poses. Accelerometer and gyroscope features are useful in capturing amplitude differences of in-air gestures. In order to reduce false positive errors in recognizing Touch+Finger gestures, we defined a touch event to initiate when the recognition system was activated. We did not choose to collect pre-sensing data because various hand poses can be instantly detected when a touch occurs. Also, such data could result in erroneous results due to the considerable variation of user gesture performance [27]. Furthermore, starting the system when a touch occurs helps the secondary fingers to avoid collision with unintentional finger movements. This is because the secondary fingers tend to be still unless triggered by the user's intention while the primary finger is touching the screen. Taking all of the above into consideration, we designed the classifier to be activated while a touchscreen detects a touch event.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_7": "In order to implement Touch+Finger gestures as new interaction techniques, it is necessary to track the motions of fingers in the air. Therefore, we built a Touch+Finger prototype to detect touch and in-air gestures. While there are a number of sensing techniques to track finger movements in the air (e.g., vision-based techniques [5,8] and capacitive sensors [12]), our prototype utilized two finger-worn devices with IMU sensors attached [24], which was simple, robust, and reliable enough for an initial exploration of Touch+Finger gestures. This setup was used for the demonstration of several interaction techniques with the gestures, spanning the outlined design space and demonstrating the viability of this approach. Figure 3 shows the prototype, which consists of two ringlike devices with IMU sensors attached, a touch-based device (in this case, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet), and a PC for data processing. The IMU sensor board included 9-axis inertial motion sensors (i.e., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer), providing the three-axis data from these sensors, as well as yaw, pitch, and roll (maximum 100Hz output rate). The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network. The tethered flexbile USB made the ring-like devices less bulky by eliminating the need for a battery and a Wi-Fi module, which minimized any inconvenience to finger movements.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_para_10": "Although the current prototype was sufficient for an initial exploration and evaluation of Touch+Finger gestures, there is still room for improvement. Since the ring-like devices were wired to an external PC, a smaller, self-contained form of the ring device is desired. We believe that it is conceivable to further miniaturize the device until it is a standalone wearable ring device like commercial products [14,20]. Nonetheless, our techniques require wearing multiple rings to track the motions of secondary fingers, which may be somewhat impractical for some users. This could be addressed in the future by exploring alternatives such as a depth camera [5,18] or capacitive sensors [17] to detect multiple finger movements. For example, the hover-sensing techniques used in [17] can track fingers up to 35mm above the screen, which might be applicable to some of the Touch+Finger gestures.", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_5": "Choice of consumer-grade recording hardware.

The beep is regarded as an impulse signal, and the user has no explicit requirement of temporal preciseness W t . In other words, only D t (interonset interval, IOI) is controlled. The model divides the cognitive process in synchronisation tasks into two parts: an internal time-keeping process is followed by a motor response with time delay. Both time-keeping precision and motor delay are assumed to be stochastic and separately represented by additive random noise with a mean and variance. Noise components can be extracted from a tapping experiment by examining autocorrelation in consecutive asynchronies [39]. The variance of the time-keeping process linearly increases with IOI [27,29], There is a similarity here to the model of ballistic movements in the spatial domain, in which the SD of end location linearly increases with target amplitude D s . We will use this linearity as a primary assumption in our model. By contrast, variance in motor responses remained relatively constant and lower than time-keeping variance. This implies that variance in motor responses dominates in fast tapping (IOI sub-250 ms).", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_metadata": "Authors: Jun Gong, Aakar Gupta, Hrvoje Benko | Venue: ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology | Year: 2020 | Fields: Computer Science | Publication Types: JournalArticle, Book, Conference", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "e4afb5f166a82e5ff55d1a2fac2312c93a71b036_title": "\"It's only when somebody says a tool worked for them that I believe it will work for me\": Socio-tecture as a lens for Digital Transformation", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_para_2": "Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stance for destination unseen targets by learning stance features from known targets (Allaway and McKeown, 2020).

To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use.

While significant research has been conducted in the storm risk community on how people receive, seek, and utilize risk information, given the importance of computing technologies and social media in these activities, human-centered design stands to make important contributions to this area. Drawing on an extensive literature review and 48 interviews with hurricane experts and members of the public, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a broad overview of hurricane risk communication. We then offer a set of guiding insights to inform HCI research work in this domain. Finally, we identify 6 opportunities that future human centered design work might pursue. In sum, this paper offers an invitation and a starting point for HCI to take up the problem of hurricane risk communication.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_18": "Over the past fve decades tropical cyclones have, on average, killed 10,000 people and caused $15 billion dollars in damage a year [37]. These impacts are only predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change and continued population growth and urban development in storm prone areas [55] [67]. Improving the ways in which science can help at-risk communities understand, prepare for, and mitigate the impacts of major storm events is thus a critical task, and one to which HCI can make important contributions. In this paper we provide an overview of an initial research agenda for HCI that focuses on communicating risk information to the public during the predictive phase of storms. As HCI research in this space continues to develop, we anticipate that further opportunities will develop and that we may also take on related questions, such as risk communications focused primarily in urban and regional planning decisions aimed at mitigating storm risk, rather than taking protective action in the lead-up period. Inasmuch as we argue that HCI can support this agenda, we also believe that our feld would be enriched through focus on these issues. Questions of representation of uncertainty, trust in information, and the human relationship to the environment are critical areas of work across HCI that research into tropical storm risk communication may inform.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_11": "HCI has already contributed important fndings to understanding how people share visual imagery of storm impacts on social media, including the importance of contextualization to one's local area and of representing uncertainty [11]. These fndings may be built upon further through augmented or virtual reality techniques that have been experimented with in science education and visualizations about climate change and disaster [10]. The Weather Channel has also used these tools to communicate disaster risk to the public [56]. AR/VR tools have also been used by HCI research into science education [106]. Such approaches ofer the potential to deliver contextualized risk information to the public in ways that includes familiar local landmarks and settings, which is thought to improve user understanding and trust. Finally, including information about vulnerable communities or public resources is another tactic that may be useful. Communication of vulnerability ahead of storm arrival could provide additional information to users about potential impacts of the storm in ways that support decision-making or improved understanding of hurricane risk.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_0": "Despite signifcant progress, there are a number of persistent challenges in regard to efective communication of expert knowledge about storm risk to the public. For example, research has shown that graphics are more efective at communicating risk than text products, yet members of the public often have trouble interpreting commonly used graphics used to describe hurricane projections [26] [96] [105]. In addition, ofcial information created and disseminated by hurricane experts at NOAA or local emergency management ofces is increasingly competing for the public's attention with other sources of information including mainstream and social media and information received from neighbors, friends, and family-members. Another challenge is that many contextual factors, including prior experience with storms, socioeconomic status, and behaviors of an individual's social networks, infuence people's decisions to prepare, evacuate, or take other protective actions prior to storms [15] [32]. Prior work in HCI has highlighted the importance of further in vivo studies through contextual inquiry or other methods in order to address the wide variety of contexts in which the public accesses and interprets risk information [11].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_4": "HCI research has also examined online risk communication as it relates to public health crisis events. For example, Pine et al found that ofcial risk communication about COVID-19 in the United States was too often contradictory, complex, or changing, so that the public often turned to their own social networks in the absence of clear signals from ofcials [103]. A study of online conversations during the Zika epidemic highlighted the challenges citizens faced with authoritative risk information and the countermeasures they took to fnd trustworthy guidance for their decision-making [46]. The extreme uncertainty of the Zika epidemic gave rise to multidimensional and speculative risk perceptions, highlighting the need for a more participatory approach to risk communication that engages laypeople/members of the public along with experts [47]. Such fndings demonstrate the opportunity for HCI to contribute to the improvement of risk communication during hurricane events, both on-and ofine.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_9": "The signifcant amount of expertise that is utilized by forecasters to model and project hurricane threat and impacts can create the impression that the information they produce is somehow neutral or merely technical in nature. Indeed, prior work has demonstrated that risk information can \"hide the basic normative questions essential to ... decision-making in the mystique of statistics\" [39]. One efect of this is to create a counterproductive hierarchy between experts and the local knowledge and lived experiences of at-risk communities [2] [58] [75]. However, any efort to quantify complex phenomena such as the potential impact of storms on local communities will necessarily involve judgment calls and value-laden decisions [118]. These concerns align with work in HCI and critical data studies that seek to unpack and mitigate the various ways in which data standards, algorithms, and other socio-technical processes contain biases and assumptions that refect the interest and worldviews of those who create them, simultaneously excluding and marginalizing other perspectives [9] [43] [62] [63] [94]. Risk communication is often conceived of as a process whereby experts, such as forecasters and meteorologists, transfer knowledge about potential threats to the public for their response [4] [30]. This one-way communication, referred to variously as the broadcast, defcit, or transmission model, has come under scrutiny from various directions, but is still largely characteristic of many risk communication processes [30] [114]. Critiques of these approaches argue that science and risk-intensive protective action design problems are inherently interdisciplinary and require more knowledge than any single person or discipline possesses [3] and that knowledge relevant to hurricane risk is distributed among residents of afected areas as much as scientists and other experts. New insights, ideas, and methods for communicating and activating hurricane risk information will arise by bringing diferent, even contested, points of view together to create a shared or at least collective understanding among those participants of a hurricane decision-making process. Risk-informed decision-making should be conceived of as a series of personal interactions with information tools and artifacts mediated by familiar groups of people and knowledge communities [3]. New technologies, artifacts, workfows, and participatory processes should aford those exposed to hurricane risk to contribute to the framing and resolving the complex problem of risk communication and protective action.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_3": "Crisis informatics research has only recently begun to examine risk communication. With regards to tropical storm risk, crisis informatics and social computing research has utilized digital traces on social media as a means to understand people's online and ofine behaviors during hurricane events. For example, by using social media data from people directly impacted by hurricanes, Metaxa-Kakavouli et al. [77] found that evacuation behavior is associated with social capital, i.e. the breadth of one's extended social network. In other work, Bica et al. [11] classifed hurricane risk images shared by authorities on social media throughout the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season and described their prevalence, difusion, and reception by the public. Their study supports prior risk communication research that suggests that emphasizing, rather than obscuring, uncertainty or alternative outcomes in visualizations may support better decision-making by viewers [45] [48].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_14": "When considering uncertainty in the context of hurricane risk communication, several approaches can be adopted from HCI. First, many hurricane risk graphics tend to highlight the certainty of forecasts rather than the uncertainty. For example the cone and spaghetti plots are among the most common visualizations of hurricane track forecasts. Yet the representations of uncertainty they provide, if any, are often difculty to assess. The ofcial NHC track forecast cone graphics (typically) include a text disclaimer at the top that reads: \"Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm center but does not show the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the cone. \" Yet, most other depictions of the cone by news and media organizations do not include the disclaimer, nor any alternative. Spaghetti plots are non-standardized and unregulated by government organizations, and in many media representations do not even ofer the model names corresponding to each forecast track, much less associated probabilities or uncertainties. Thus, there is much opportunity for HCI and information visualization research to continue studying efective methods for uncertainty visualization approaches for hurricane forecasts [20] [105] [109] [113] [133].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_1": "Research in tropical storm risk communication has found that there are several components of efective public messaging. Communicating risk efectively requires consistent, clear, and concise messaging that is not fear-based [23] [31] [79] [82] [84]. Trust, whether in an organization, government agency, or spokesperson, is a major factor for risk reduction and protective action in weather-related hazards [81] [130]. This trusted authority should be working with a variety of institutions, scientists, and public ofcials to communicate accurate messages with 'one voice' [36]. Risk communication may be unidirectional, top-down communication from authorities to the public, which is often the case during a hazard event; however, there is growing evidence that two-way dialogue between the message creators and message receivers is more efective, in both crisis situations and in disaster mitigation [4] [35].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_5": "Human-centered design (HCD) is an area of research and practice that is being taken up in multiple domains as a means of understanding the distinct needs, capacities, and contexts of use for a range of technologies. For example, within the HCI community, health researchers use HCD to discover needs beyond curing diseases, such as empowering patients to \"gain greater control over decisions and actions afecting their health\" [74], helping patients support each other and learn from each other using online health communities [24], and using visualizations to better communicate risks to patients [112]. Other domains where human centered design approaches have made contributions include education [64], sustainability [65], personal informatics [38], mental health [34], and accessibility [8]. Through taking a broader perspective of problems and focusing on the experiences of people most impacted by the problem, HCD can open avenues for multiple kinds of insights and solutions into complex design challenges. In this paper we bring this lens to a similarly difcult set of questions, those raised by eforts to communicate information about tropical storm risk to the public.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_16": "Here we demonstrate the potential through examination of two user groups. 5.6.2 Future work. First, research in disaster risk communication has identifed important diferences in information-seeking behavior needs between disabled and non-disabled user groups [120]. For example, one study has found that hearing-impaired persons rely most on friends and family for hurricane risk information, while non-hearing-impaired persons with disabilities rely on television sources more than internet sources [72]. At present, most risk information sources available to the public are not geared towards people with disabilities [101], which can result in a lack of targeted services and assistance to these users [128]. HCI has a strong tradition of research in the area of accessibility that stands to contribute to developing a more robust understanding of how hurricane risk information design can better meet the needs of people with disabilities. Recent work in this feld suggests that such investigations would be best accomplished through extended and iterative collaboration with people with disabilities [8].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_17": "Second, hurricane risk has an inherently spatial character. Risk information is therefore most actionable when it is specifc to users' locations [70]. Our interviews with both staf of the National Hurricane Center and members of the public raised the opportunity for hurricane risk information products to be further localized in order to assist the public in locating the hazards and potential impacts that are relevant to where they live and work [52] [71]. What is geographically relevant is infuenced by user-specifc factors, such as risk perception, the infuence of neighbors, residence construction, access to transportation, awareness of evacuation zones, and media reference to local landmarks [124]. Many of our interviewees noted the difculty in accessing localized forecasts and protective action recommendations from government information products and social media posts, highlighting that ofcial hurricane risk maps are typically at the regional or national scale. HCI work in areas such as geo-visualization [41] [49] thus stands to support users by developing products and interfaces that deliver localized information.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_10": "Second, HCI scholars have developed an active area of research in the areas of visualizing uncertainty. This work may be relevant to developing alternative ways of accomplishing the risk communication goals of the cone graphic and spaghetti models [44] [54] [60]. One study has even explored how certain forms of graphical interaction may support science education goals by helping users learn to improve their ability to evaluate uncertainty in other contexts [53]. Research in the feld of risk communication has argued for almost two decades that providing users with information about the degree and source of uncertainty in forecast models improves their trust in information sources and supports decision-making [88]. Yet more work remains to be done to develop approaches to doing so that inform rather than confuse users. ", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_6": "Finally, we interviewed 36 members of the public from four hurricane-prone states in the United States: New York, Texas, Louisiana, and North Carolina. These states were chosen to refect a range of storm type and frequency profles. Participants were recruited through professional networks of our research team and social media channels. Though we did not formally screen participants, we note that a wide diversity of racial, gender, language, and personal experiences with disasters were represented across the interviews. The interviews lasted on average around 35 minutes and focused on detailed understanding of individuals' experiences with hurricanes over the last decade. We asked questions about where participants sought information, how they evaluated between competing forecasts, key decisions such as whether to evacuate or prepare in other ways, what factors infuenced these decisions. Prior research in risk communication has conducted systematic, quantitative research into some of these questions [5] [18] [29] [52]. Here, drawing on design research practice, our priority was to gather detailed stories from the target audience of risk communications to understand the breadth and complexity of the design space.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_7": "Many of the central challenges of tropical storm risk communication stem from the gulf of understanding between expert knowledge about storms and popular mental models surrounding risk and uncertainty [15]. Bridging that gulf requires, at minimum, greater understanding of the public's knowledge and beliefs about these topics and may require thinking diferently about how risk models are currently constructed. A standard expert view about forecasts is the notion that a good or efective model is one that is a good predictor -where model outputs accurately match an empirical dataset [110]. However, the usefulness of a weather model for decision-making, is not guaranteed by a good empirical match [7] [66] [78] [95]. On this point Norton [93] argues that models used for decision support must help policymakers and the public to formulate and measure goals efectively, as well as propose and implement plans and policies to reach these goals. Even accurate model predictions may be miscommunicated or misused, resulting in undesirable outcomes [51]. Similarly, the output of a forecast can be efectively communicated, but may not be of a form useful to stakeholders within their specifc decision context. The diferences between expert understanding and the public's needs for hurricane risk information thus creates signifcant challenges for communicating storm risk. The cone of uncertainty, one of the more common hurricane information products [15], exemplifes some of the challenges of risk communication. Pictured in Figure 1, the cone graphic shows the probable path of the storm center over time. The cone in the image delineates the boundaries enclosing two-thirds of modeled tracks based on historical data; thus, there is estimated a 66% chance that the center for the storm will be within the cone during the projected time frame [87]. The cone shape depicts a narrow range of possible storm track boundaries in the more immediate forecast, which expands into a greater range due to increased uncertainty of the track forecast further into the future. Prior work in risk communications has found that the public frequently misinterprets these images in a number of ways, including believing the size of the cone to represent hurricane intensity or that areas outside of the cone were out of the danger area [19] [109]. An alternative to the cone, the so-called \"spaghetti plot\", or ensemble graphic ( Figure  2), shows individual tracks of selected models, but also struggles to efectively communicate uncertainty. The distinct tracks tend to be read as overly deterministic, especially when they coincide with signifcant landmarks [96]. Interpreting spaghetti plots can also be more cognitively taxing than for other visual hurricane forecast representations [26]. We return to the question of the cone in Section 5.1.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_13": "Much of the discussion about uncertainty in science and risk communication treats uncertainty as problematic, or as a challenge to be overcome [119]. Hence there is intense focus on identifying and reducing sources of uncertainty in risk models and developing efective means of communicating the remainder. While such eforts are no doubt essential, there are several strands of work in HCI that explore the benefts of engaging with uncertainty. Research in the area of ambiguous design, for example, has argued that purposeful inclusion of ambiguity can support deeper appropriation of complex technologies by users [42]. Game design rests on careful use of uncertainty to create tension, challenge, and engagement from participants [25]. Prior crisis informatics research in food risk visualization has explored the role of serious games and deliberative risk communication strategies to support deeper understanding of complex information about disaster [116]. Such approaches also show promise in the context of tropical storm risk communication [12].", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_12": "Top-down approaches to addressing this issue include working to craft or amplify messaging from ofcial sources in ways that ensure reliable information is more visible or resonant with target audiences than other sources. For example, work in crisis informatics has recommended useful practices for sharing ofcial information over social media, in particular how the inclusion of details such as geo-location, location-referencing information, and situational update categories may, if judiciously employed, help afected communities to establish situational awareness [121] [122] [134]. An example of a conscientiously constructed tweet that applies a combination of geo-location and situational update information: \"Fire Warning for Love Co. People east of Oswalt rd near/ Mariette to evacuate to the east\" [121]. Journalists, and in particular broadcast meteorologists, also play an important role in coping with the volume of information, in providing context and explanation for ofcial information. They also engage with information on social media and can help to combat misinformation and rumors [123]. Further work in applying these insights to the hurricane risk communication space could substantially help ensure lifesaving information reaches the public during storms.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_15": "5.5.2 Future work. Some members of the public we spoke to about their information-seeking behavior described developing a range of intricate and intentional hurricane risk information processes specifc for their decision needs, risk tolerance, and possible protective actions. This was particularly true for those who had lived in the same area for a signifcant period of time and experienced multiple major storm events. Indeed, despite stereotypes of the public being irrational, uninformed, or helpless victims during emergencies, decades of research have shown that people are likely to behave rationally, according to available information, during crises [40]. The complex approaches developed by some members of the public typically entailed networks of hyper-local knowledge communities, social cues, employer protocols, national and local news media, social media, weather apps, and government alert subscriptions. Engaging such \"leading users\" in participatory processes around the evaluation and improvement of risk information tools could lead to novel insights and improved design. In addition, participatory design processes may help shift design processes away from scientifc proof, technical feasibility, and institutional viability that experts focus on, and toward more practical information needs of the public during storms [97]. Participatory design of hurricane risk information products would allow participants to deliberate about issues of hurricane risk that directly afect them, their relations, or their sources of livelihood. Involving those considered \"non-experts\" in hurricane risk information design processes is therefore a strategy for ensuring that concern for the public good is placed ahead of the success and reputation of experts or their organizations [39]. Evidence from related felds suggest that this may further legitimize the development and implementation of hurricane risk information, tools, policies, and plans [66] [129]. The co-construction of knowledge that can occur when experts and at-risk communities collaborate around issues characterized by deep uncertainty has the potential to rebalance priorities and power relationships between these groups in favor of more productive partnerships and increased public safety [116] [131]. 5.6 Designing for diferent audiences 5.6.1 Background. As discussed in Section 4.4, people's information needs as well as how they seek out and interpret storm information vary widely. Our interviews with people who had experienced hurricanes further reinforced the fnding that \"the public\" is a diverse set of groups with distinct needs [82] [83]. These needs aren't often aligned with the original design goals of an existing information product or those of other users, particularly experts in the weather forecast community or emergency response. Our interviews with staf of the National Hurricane Center found that while some efort is made to provide specialized information to some groups, such as mariners, there is signifcant opportunity to further develop products that more specifcally target particular user groups' needs. Such needs may be determined by residential or work location, economic status, technology use, and disability status. Further research into hurricane risk information, along with standard human-centered design techniques such as persona development and user-journey tracking, may assist in determining how to meaningfully segment \"the public\" into user groups to inform the efective design of hurricane risk information for diverse audiences.", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_2": "Crisis informatics is an area of research and design within HCI that focuses on how digital technologies shape information seeking and sharing behavior related to disaster [99] [118]. Drawing upon classic scholarship in disaster studies, crisis informatics has highlighted the important ways in which members of the public play important roles in circulating and reinterpreting ofcial disaster information [125]. This research has also discussed the public's use of technologies in coordinating informal, emergent citizen response to disasters [132]. As with risk communications, crisis informatics has documented the vital role of journalists in interpreting and broadcasting expert information about disaster [28]. While the feld is best known for its contributions to understand the role of social media during moments of crisis [100] [107], other work in the area has looked at a wider range of technologies and temporalities relevant to hurricane risk including research into disaster risk models [116], post-disaster impact assessments [116], and the design of smartphone applications for creating and sharing disaster information [59].", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_para_8": "expensive; trust is therefore essential Activities such as evacuation, boarding up storefronts and windows, and others that risk communication experts refer to as protective decision-making can be difcult or expensive undertakings, thus it is crucial that the public trust the information they are receiving. Many of our interviewees described situations such as lacking funds for gas or hotel-rooms, not owning a car, or having family members that weren't physically able to evacuate that made evacuation challenging. This research fnds that \"before deciding to take a disruptive and often expensive action such as evacuation, people must understand the forecast; believe it applies to them; and, most important, feel that they and/or their loved ones are at risk\" [81] [6] [127]. Best practices in risk communication thus emphasize that risk warnings need to be clear and come from a trusted source [88]. While it is necessary to convey the serious nature of storm threat, it is critical to not overstate risks. Multiple interviewees told us that their trust in information sources had been negatively afected based on their perception, whether true or not, that the risk of previous hurricanes had been exaggerated. For example, one told us:", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event",

Such reliance can be problematic, especially with evolving evidence (Wikipedia pages are constantly updated to reflect the latest events). Schuster et al. (2019) illustrate this phenomenon through an example fact, \"Halep failed to ever win a Wimbledon title\", which was valid until July 2019 but not thereafter.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_3": "Our experiments adopt the popular three-stage pipeline of FEVER task, comprising document selection, evidence sentence extraction, and claim verification (Thorne et al., 2018b).

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_3": "More recently, semantic matching methods were proposed to retrieve evidence from relatively trustworthy sources such as checked news and Wikipedia articles. Popat et al. (2018) attempted to debunk false claims by learning claim representations from relevant articles using an attention mechanism to focus on words that are closely related to the claim. Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules. Similar pipelines were developed by most of the participating teams (Nie et al., 2019;Padia et al., 2018;Alhindi et al., 2018;Hanselowski et al., 2018) in FEVER shared task (Thorne et al., 2018b).

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_0": "Not surprisingly, various methods for automatic claim verification have been proposed using machine learning.

However, the factuality of a claim is independent of people's belief and subjective language use, and human perception is unconsciously prone to misinformation due to the common cognitive biases such as naive realism (Reed et al., 2013) and confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998).", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_5": "Our approach exploits and integrates two core semantic relations: 1) coherence of the sentences given the claim; 2) entailment relation between the claim and each sentence, which are described more specifically below.

In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency. Textual Entailment: Entailment is used to measure whether a piece of evidence semantically infers a given claim. We propose an entailmentbased attention component that can be pre-trained to capture entailment relations (Dagan et al., 2010;Bowman et al., 2015) based on sentence pairs labeled with NLI-specific classes: entails, contradicts and neutral. This pre-trained component together with the entire claim verification framework then will be trained end-to-end to attend on the salient sentences for inferring the claim.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence.

The essence of outdoor play is \"heads up\" social interaction and physical activity [11,16,31,43], which are not natural characteristics of coding activities. Moreover, adding screens to outdoor play (a coding platform running on a tablet device) is thought to interfere with natural play patterns [34] and compromise the benefits of natural play [44]. Nonetheless, the children successfully bridged this gap, using the \"heads down\" coding activity to create code that generates a \"heads up\" outdoor game experience. In addition, children played their games with their friends with no further adjustments to the code, indicating that they were able to program playable outdoor games. This may be attributed to the clear distinction between the coding platform and the digital device, that framed the coding platform as a tool for defining the game and the device as a tool for playing the game. Future work should test this assumption and compare the digital coding platform to a more tangible coding platform. While physical programming may preserve the \"heads up\" nature of outdoor play, it may also be perceived as part of the game instead of a mechanism for defining the game rules.", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_abstract": "Outdoor play is in decline, including its benefits to children's development. Coding, a typically indoor, screen-based activity, can potentially enrich outdoor play, serving as a rule-making medium. We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device, enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas, coding them, and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study, 24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones, enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements, integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code, and were excited to see their code come to life. We conclude children can use coding to express their ideas by creating technologically-enhanced outdoor play experiences.", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_para_2": "Experience with coding from a young age is thought to extend children's ability to design, create, and invent [37,40,41]. Coding activities are considered to promote analytical thinking, abstraction abilities, [7,40,47,48], and computational literacy [20]. As coding becomes common in many schools, a wide range of approaches should be developed for introducing coding to diverse audiences. Outdoor play adds a unique nature to coding, and may appeal to children in ways that traditional coding activities do not, especially to children who are \"outdoor play-fluent\" [19].", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_para_3": "However, the integration of coding and outdoor play is not trivial.

Outdoor play is known to have positive effects on child development, including practicing problem-solving, creative thinking, and abstraction [1,11,16].

RePlay demonstrates this approach using video; different activities (e.g., programming) may benefit from other types of content (e.g., text resources). RePlay could naturally be extended to any textual content (or content with textual metadata). Text results could be displayed as short summaries with clickable keywords to expand more detail [13]. For detecting context, RePlay used MacOS's accessibility api; other oss (e.g. Windows [34]) also have similar apis.

How could CUIs be turned into 'DIY', 'bottom-up' critical technology shaped by children, in order to nurture children's refections about futures? 4.1.1 Approach. To turn CUIs into a vessel of future-focused conversations for children, we explored critical and co-design inspired methods attuned to children's development. We adapted a co-design method developed in the child-robot interaction feld: PeerPlay, Perspective Taking in Embodied Role-Play [87,89]. This method was developed by Zaga et al. [87] to co-generate nonverbal robot behavior and co-refect about a robot's agency. Role-playing and perspectivetaking are prioritized in the method; both are central for children's understanding of agency.

We utilized a set of stimulus-free two-task BCI control strategies that were previously evaluated in laboratory experiments with healthy subjects. The control strategies have shown to be immediately executable by subjects without the need for prior training, and they are unrelated to motor processes, which limits accidental movement artifacts. Most importantly, they induce modulation of neural activity in broad areas of the cortex, which could make them particularly suitable for use with consumer-grade EEG equipment with few sensors. We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4]. Now, we complement the laboratory results with MYND to investigate whether these strategies can be executed in an uncontrolled, realistic environment, by utilizing a consumer-grade EEG, and if repeated execution affects performance.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_7": "Control strategy evaluation. With this study, we aim to evaluate how well the BCI control strategies can be performed in an uncontrolled, realistic setting and consumer-grade hardware, outside of the laboratory. The small amount of trials scheduled per day (18 to 36), recorded with a consumer-grade EEG, makes it challenging to learn a good decoding model per subject, day, and strategy. To solve this problem, we leveraged the information obtained from previous laboratory trials with a transfer-learning approach ( [39], toolbox available online 6 , additional details in [11]). Here, a linear regression model for each subject in the at-home study is learned while regularizing the regression weights with a Gaussian prior that is learned on existing laboratory data. The three-step implementation, which we describe below, also resembles a possible procedure for daily on-device feedback that would be immediately accessible to subjects in future studies.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_abstract": "Neurophysiological laboratory studies are often constraint to immediate geographical surroundings and access to equipment may be temporally restricted. Limitations of ecological validity, scalability, and generalizability of findings pose a significant challenge for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which ultimately need to function in any context, on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce MYND: An open-source framework that couples consumer-grade recording hardware with an easy-to-use application for the unsupervised evaluation of BCI control strategies. Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording, and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires at home. As a use case, thirty subjects evaluated two BCI control strategies \"Positive memories\" and \"Music imagery\" by using a four-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) with MYND. Neural activity in both control strategies could be decoded with an average offline accuracy of 68.5% and 64.0% across all days.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing

We reconstructed the retained signal quality during trial execution with the same processing pipeline as described earlier, and we plotted the \"Resting-state\" EEG spectrum, averaged over both parietal channels, for a visual inspection of the recorded data. During the \"Resting-state,\" subjects are asked to either open or close their eyes and let their mind wander. Alpha-band-power increases visibly during closed-eyes resting. Therefore this strategy is often used as a benchmark for EEG recording setups (e.g., [37]). Concerning the subject's satisfaction with the system, we present the post-experiment ratings of the application in an online survey, to which 25 subjects responded. We report the dimensions \"perceived ease-of-use\", \"perceived enjoyment\", and \"perceived external control\" of the Technology Acceptance Model [25,TAM], as well as \"temporal demand\", \"frustration\", and \"effort\" of the NASA Task Load Index [26,TLX], and a 10-point total satisfaction score, as proposed in [38] for BCI development.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_1": "Regarding the overall satisfaction with the platform, 25 subjects participated in a post-experiment online survey. On the Technology Acceptance Model dimensions [25,TAM], subjects rated perceived ease-of-use with a median score of 5.8/7, perceived enjoyment with a score of 5.6/7, and perceived control over the application with a 6.3/7. On the NASA Task Load Index dimensions [26,TLX], ratings for frustration, temporal demand, and required effort were low with a median score of 5/21, 8/21, and 7/21. Subjects rated their median overall satisfaction with an 8/10. Figure 4 shows the results of the unsupervised, daily use of both control strategies on consumer-grade hardware. In (A), we show the average classification accuracies for both strategies in the at-home study, with an overall average accuracy of 68.5% for \"Positive memories\" and 64.0% for \"Music imagery.\" Grey circles indicate the achieved accuracies per day, where we observe within-subject differences with an average standard deviation of 20.3%. We find a small negative trend between mean accuracy and standard deviation (Pearson's r(58) = \u2212.25, p = .0505). In (B), we relate these accuracies to the signal quality during trials. We find a small positive trend between daily signal quality and daily accuracies (r(224) = .13, p = .06). We relate accuracies to the day of study in (C). In general, we find a small negative correlation between the day of study and performance (r(224) = \u2212.18, p = .006). \"Positive memories\" shows a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 1, and then exhibits a drop in median accuracy to 63.3% during repeated execution from day 1 to day 2. After not executing the strategy on day 3, we observe an increase to 77.8% on day 4, and a subsequent drop to 72.2% and 55.6% on days 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-six \"Positive memories\" trials were scheduled on days 2 and 6, which is the highest daily amount in this study. In \"Music imagery\", we find a median accuracy of 72.2% on day 3, where it was introduced as the only scheduled strategy. Then, we find a decrease to 59.7% on day 5, where both strategies were scheduled, and a subsequent increase to 66.6% on day 7, where only \"Music imagery\" was scheduled. With respect to the two potential mediators meditation experience and daily self-reported motivation, we found that meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies (M = 1.

On the other hand, we found a high variation of daily accuracies within subjects. The consumer-grade EEG and our fitting algorithm allowed subjects to record neural data quickly, but the hardware may also pose new challenges for the BCI user: Even when perfectly fitted, the dry sensors at distant ends of the scalp may require users to induce strong, consistent modulations in neural activity in order to be reliably detected. As one potential mediator, meditation experience may affect the ability to maintain focus in unsupervised environments [27]. However, in a post-hoc analysis, we found that self-reported meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies in this study. On the other hand, daily motivational scores correlate positively with accuracy in this study. Therefore, using the MYND platform to combine easily accessible control strategies with motivating, daily feedback could further improve performance and help with more consistent execution. This feedback will need to be robust to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and higher susceptibility to involuntary head-muscle artifacts around the ears and the forehead, where the sensors are located. As one promising approach to implement robust feedback, concurrent work in [28] explored an adaptive signal-filtering method that relies on signal-variation, similar to the fitting algorithm presented here.

However, the efficacy of meta-learning crucially depends on the distribution of tasks available for training, and this is often assumed to be known a priori or constructed from limited supervised datasets. In this work, we aim to provide task distributions for meta-learning by considering self-supervised tasks automatically proposed from unlabeled text, to enable large-scale meta-learning in NLP. We design multiple distributions of self-supervised tasks by considering important aspects of task diversity, difficulty, type, domain, and curriculum, and investigate how they affect meta-learning performance. Our analysis shows that all these factors meaningfully alter the task distribution, some inducing significant improvements in downstream few-shot accuracy of the meta-learned models. Empirically, results on 20 downstream tasks show significant improvements in few-shot learning \u2013 adding up to +4.2% absolute accuracy (on average) to the previous unsupervised meta-learning method, and perform comparably to supervised methods on the FewRel 2.0 benchmark.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_para_0": "In the supervised setting, in particular, metalearning task distribution is often defined by subsampling from the classes in a classification problem over a fixed dataset (Vinyals et al., 2016).

Selfsupervised meta-learning, on the other hand, seeks to propose tasks from unlabelled data Bansal et al., 2020b), and has great potential to enable numerous important applications (Hospedales et al., 2020) such as neural architecture search, continual learning, hyper-parameter optimization, learning in low-resource settings, etc. Existing work in meta-learning for NLP, however, defaults to task distributions that tend to be overly simplistic, e.g. using existing supervised datasets (Han et al., 2018;Dou et al., 2019; or unsupervised cloze-style tasks with uniform selection of words from the vocabulary (Bansal et al., 2020b).

We experiment with various adaptations of BERT-based models (Devlin et al., 2019) trained and tested on Oracc, combined with a greedy decoding scheme to extend the prediction from single tokens to multiple words.

For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Motivated by that, we evaluate the utility of using information gain for goal-oriented visual question generation with a reinforcement learning paradigm. In this paper, we propose two different approaches for training an end-to-end architecture: first, a novel reward function that is a trade-off between the expected information gain of a question and the cost of asking it; and second, a loss function that uses regularized information gain with a step-based reward function.

Most earlier works made use of a predefined template (Lemon et al., 2006;Wang and Lemon, 2013) to generate dialogues. More recently, deep neural networks have been used for building end-to-end architectures capable of generating questions (Vinyals and Le, 2015;Sordoni et al., 2015) and also for the task of goal-oriented dialogue generation (Rajendran et al., 2018;Bordes et al., 2017).

Since its inception (Das et al., 2017), different approaches have been proposed to address this problem (Massiceti et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2017;Das et al., 2017). Goaloriented Visual Dialogue, on the other hand, is an area that has only been introduced fairly recently. De Vries et al.  proposed the GuessWhat?! dataset for goal-oriented visual dialogue while Strub et al.  developed a reinforcement learning approach for Figure 2: A block diagram of our model. The framework is trained on top of three individual models: the questioner (QGen), the guesser, and the oracle. The guesser returns an object distribution given a history of question-answer pairs that are generated by the questioner and the oracle respectively. These distributions are used for calculating the information gain of the question-answer pair. The information gain and distribution of probabilities given by the Guesser are used either as a reward or optimized as a loss function with global rewards for training the questioner.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_para_0": "Visual dialog systems are an emerging area of interdisciplinary research that attracts both the vision and language communities due to the potential applications. Das et al. (2017a) proposed a visual dialog task in which a conversational agent attempts to answer questions regarding an assigned image based on a dialog history. To approach this task, they initially collected data by having two people chat about an image with one person acting as the questioner and the other as the answerer. GuessWhich (Chattopadhyay et al., 2017) extends VisDial with the goal to build an agent that learns how to identify a target image through question and answers. (de Vries et al., 2016) additionally introduced a game in which a series of yes-or-no questions are asked by an agent in order to locate an object in an image. Many researchers approached these tasks via reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of obtaining an optimal dialog policy. Zhang et al. (2017), for example, designed three rewards with respect to the goals of task achievement, efficiency, and question informativeness, in order to help the agent to achieve an effective question generation policy for GuessWhat game. Das et al. (2017b) applies reinforcement learning in the GuessWhich task and demonstrates a moderate improvement in accuracy compared to the supervised learning approach. Both methods apply RL on a neural end-to-end pipeline to jointly influence the language generation and dialog policy. Due the challenge of designing an appropriate reward for language generation, these methods generate responses that deviate from human natural language. Zhang et al. (2018), proposed an approach involving hierarchical reinforcement learning and state-adaptation techniques that enable the agent to learn an optimal and efficient multi-modal policy. The bottleneck of (Zhang et al., 2018)'s method, however, is that the system response is retrieved from a predefined humanwritten or system-generated utterance. The number of predefined responses are limited, therefore, this method does not easily generalize to other tasks in real-world settings. We address these limitations by applying RL on a reduced, yet more relevant action space, while optimizing the dialog generator in a supervised fashion. We alternatively optimize policy learning to language generation to combine the two tasks together.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach to learn an optimal dialog policy for task-oriented visual dialog systems.

This metric computes the word count of a respondent's free-text response to an interview question. We chose this metric because previous work indicates that engaged respondents are more willing to give long responses [67]. Designers can use this metric to gauge their chatbot performance and to make corresponding design improvements (e.g., adding follow-up questions or changing a yes/no question to an open-ended question to elicit longer responses). Engagement Duration. This metric indicates how long a participant is willing to engage with an interview question. Although engagement duration alone does not signal the quality of user responses [67], we hope to use it as an indicator of potential issues with an interview question. For example, if the engagement duration of a particular open-ended interview question is exceedingly short, it might signal that the question is too narrow and needs to be rephrased to encourage more open and longer engagement. Completion Rate. This metric computes the percentage of participants completing an interview question or an entire interview. It is a commonly used metric to measure the effectiveness of an interviewer [7,20].

Finally they apply RL to learn an optimized dialog policy given the dialog state (Raux et al., 2005;Shi and Yu, 2018). Such modular-based dialog systems are effective in narrow task domains, such as searching a bus route schedule and reserving a restaurant through natural language, but they fail to generalize to complex settings where the size of the action space increases. Owing to the development of deep learning, RL on neural sequence-to-sequence models has been explored in more complex dialog domains such as open-domain conversation (Li et al., 2016) and negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017). However, due to the difficulty of assigning appropriate rewards when operating in a large action space, these frameworks cannot generate fluent dialog utterances. Zhao et al.

However, a complex question usually involves multiple facts. Therefore, a single word piece or phrase is not able to provide enough information for the generation. In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_para_3": "Question Generation, aiming at generating questions from a range of inputs, such as raw text (Heilman and Smith, 2010), structured data (Serban et al., 2016) and images (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016;Fan et al., 2018a,b), has attracted increasing attention in recent years.

Similar echos can be found when scrutinizing DIY practices in realms beyond AT; for example several authors have published critical refections on the promises of DIY maker technology used in a generic school environment [4, 75, e.g.]. Ames et al., also similar to Hofman and Meisner [37,56], question who is in control, who gets excluded, and what making could contribute to society [3]. Regarding inclusion, Marshall and Rode deconstruct the sociotechnical identity formation within maker culture through an ethnographic study of STEAM skill building activities [55]. The study found complex tensions regarding gender and (maker) technology excluding those who do not identify as male. Therefore, the question remains how maker technologies can be help to design assistive technologies that truly empower, helping \"people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over issues of concern to them\" [43] in a school environment. Regarding the use of DIY assistive technology in schools for disabled children, there is still not enough research that support the promises of empowerment in this specifc environment.", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_10": "5.1.1 Understanding technology in the context of interdependence between individuals, the organisation, and the wider community. Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]). However, this individualistic perspective overlooks how students, teachers and therapists are afected by the organisations within which they operate, and which in turn are impacted on a societal level, thereby risking to undermine ongoing processes of empowerment.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_7": "Following up on the call of Zimmerman, this work will therefore extend the recent, but still relatively modest body of work that addresses the use of DIY assistive technology in a school setting [34,38], also including how the larger socio-cultural environment contributes to its potential for empowerment.

The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59].

Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_title": "Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_2": "However, despite promising initial fndings, the adoption of making in the creation and use of assistive technology lags behind, and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist to this day [54,86].

Do-it-yourself and making (DIY) practices have long been promoted by many scholars, for the generation of assistive technologies [16,39,41,57,65,77]. In particular, it has been argued that maker technologies may lower abandonment rates [16,41]. Hurst, in a series of articles [39][40][41], adamantly argued that DIY assistive technology may help overcome barriers for adoption such as problematic ft, long delivery times, and need for adaptation. For example, rapid prototyping tools do no longer require complex manual actions such as manipulating large wooden boards on a table saw. Instead, user-friendly software renders the making process more accessible. Hurst, and others [68] argue that by empowering non-engineers to create, modify, and build their own assistive technology, more people gain access to the technology they need. Moreover, through online communities, makers can share and learn from each other [11,12]. In line with the previous arguments, Moraiti et al. created and evaluated a DIY assistive technology toolkit for occupational therapists [57]. The researchers aspired to omit the need for technical experts to support therapists while creating technological solutions for therapy [25].", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_4": "2.1.2 DIY, assistive technology and the hurdles of occupational therapists. Hofmann et al. also investigated the creation of assistive technology through digital fabrication in a clinical environment [37]. In contrast to Moraiti et al. [57], they found that existing end-user DIY fabrication does not align with clinical practice. The fail-fast and risk-taking attitude within maker communities conficts with the do-no-harm ethos of clinical practice. Occupational therapists foreground responsibility, and perceive the encouragement of self-creation of assistive technology equal to prescribing them. This prescriptive mindset also necessitates therapists to build on their available (scientifc) knowledge and expertise, and to work in a time-efcient way. These results suggest a more a nuanced view on the role of DIY fabrication in a therapist's practice, and point at the need for specifc making tools and processes that align with clinical practice. First, the authors suggest to minimise the required iterations needed from the therapist, at the cost of innovation. Second, the authors call for resource awareness; to emphasise what is feasible both in terms of material qualities, availability, and cost. And third, in the therapists' prescribed model to ofer assistive technology to their clients, the authors emphasize to limit making to physical adaptations where therapists tweak designs physically, using adaptable materials and quick fabrication methods. Slegers et al. [77] also investigated the attitudes of occupational therapists towards DIY assistive technology, specifcally using 3D printing technologies. In their studies, therapists saw benefts in DIY assistive technology to increase user satisfaction due to a better ft (both in functional and aesthetic way), and the potential of decreasing social stigma for their clients. Slegers et al. used a technology adoption framework (UTAUT) [83] to assess the potential of 3D printing technology to be accepted and used by occupational therapists. Interestingly, they found efort expectancy (i.e., perceived ease-of-use) and facilitating conditions (i.e., available infrastructure) to be lacking and restrain the potential of 3D printing technology. Therapists raised concerns regarding the required time to learn and produce 3D prints and emphasised the associated costs, which they thought would not be accepted by their employers. These concerns remained among therapists, also after having hands-on experiences with the technology. In order to make DIY assistive technology work, according to this study and from a therapist perspective, 3D printing professionals need to be involved in complement to therapists. This call for involving technology experts also aligns with the fndings of Norrie et al., who argue for the introduction of an 'assistive technologist' when introducing high-tech devices in schools for disabled children. [61] 2.1.3 DIY, assistive technology and the school environment. Studies that investigate the potential of DIY technologies in the context of schools for disabled children are still relatively sparse, the majority of maker studies and assistive technologies focus on physical rehabilitation [16,76] within a clinical realm [35,37]. However, in 2016, Bueler et al. explored the use of 3D printers in special education schools 2 [13]. They found there is interest in using 3D printing in special education, yet several barriers for adoption of 3D printing remain related to budgetting time for training, maintenance of the printer and ensuring equal access. More recently, M\u00e4kal\u00e4 and Vellonen did explore the use of DIY toolkits by educators in the context of special education schools [52]. The authors found that openness of the DIY toolkit (in this case Makey Makey [14]) to be an ambivalent factor, as educators were uncertain in how to make the best use of it. Educators struggled with ftting this creative, yet time-consuming, appropriation process into the reality of special education schools. In the past years, toolkits have come out for disabled children and their educators in a school environment, such as Sensebox [33], Tapeblock [20], or the SocialPlayToolkit [71]. These toolkits may resolve some of these issues related to the need for training and openness. This latter toolkit was designed through a three year situated co-design practice in a school environment to empower neurodiverse children. In relation to this this toolkit, the authors particularly highlight the importance of infrastructuring, in order words, the importance of considering socio-material aspects accompanying the toolkit, so that when leaving the feld, integration of the technology in practice is facilitated. Related to infrastructuring and education in low-resource settings, Rosner and Ames discuss processes of breakdown and repair [69] of the \"XO\" laptops of One Laptop Per Child in Paraguay [4]. The authors argue that breakdown and repair is tied to material realities. The political and social context of technology infrastructure, including manufacturing limitations and situational access to repair parts and expertise, is inherent to these processes of breakdown and repair, yet they cannot efectively be anticipated by designers. In response, authors promote 'negotiated endurance' among diferent actors, recognizing the importance of the local actors to facilitate ongoing use.  [56] to empower disabled people, pointed out that while DIY assistive technology is believed to be democratising design and manifacturing [80], the maker community does lack demographic diversity, and thus also diversity in who controls the design and production process. Moreover, they note that in the context of DIY assistive technology, it is seldomly the individual with a disability who is producing the technology. Instead, the design and creation of DIY assistive technology is still done by people with technical expertise, who have become part of an extended care network. This fnding is echoed by other researchers as well [12,87]; most of the makers are people without disabilities. In the words of Hofmann, do-it-yourself is still do-it-for others (DFO) [37]. These authors link DFO to non-use of assistive technology and strongly advocate for involving disabled people as active stakeholders in its production [56]. This apparent paradox between do-it-yourself and relying on others is also noted by Toombs et al. [81]. In an ethnographic study, the authors participated as members of a hackerspace, discussing the care ethos of making culture: its integral values of collaboration and community aspect, yet how this sits on top of its neoliberal ethos, celebrating self-determination and independence. The authors expand the notion of hacking from understanding how to reassemble physical and digital materials to citizens contributing to the social good, and 'making' community -or what the authors called 'hacker-care'.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_15": "The lead author worked together with Amy (a pseudonym), the Head of Performing Arts in a UK Secondary School (ages [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] from July 2018 to January 2020.

However, as pointed out by Schneider et al. [72], the current discourse in HCI is characterized by a fuzzy understanding and delineation of what exactly is meant with empowerment. Schneider et al., building on the afore defnition of empowerment by Rappaport [43] highlight the many diferent conceptualizations of empowerment in HCI, distinguishing four dimensions in which empowerment can be understood: 1) envisioning empowerment either as power-to (i.e., the ability to act) or power-over (power in relation to others); 2) the psychological component of empowerment, distinguishing feeling, knowing and doing; 3) the persistence of empowerment, being either transient or persistent; and fnally 4) the design mindset, either expert-led or participatory. While the authors do not promote one conceptualization of empowerment over another, they point out that it is important for scholars to articulate their specifc stance and consequent decisions when investigating or designing for empowerment. When elaborating on the diferent dimensions of, and in particular the psychological component of empowerment, Schneider et al. also pointed to Zimmerman's Empowerment Theory [90]. This framework is geared towards rehabilitation sciences and healthcare, thus particularly suited for HCI studies that relate empowerment to disabled people and assistive technology. Zimmerman et al. distinguish three fundamental components of empowerment in rehabilitation: 1) control and access to resources; 2) participation with others; and 3) critical awareness of the sociopolitical environment. Interestingly, Zimmerman also points out that these three outcomes are to be infuenced at three interdependent levels of analysis: the individual, the organisational, and the community level (see Figure 1). For example, whereas a sense of control at the individual level is geared towards supporting an individual to gain mastery to act, at the community level this is geared towards organisations working together to exert control over policy decisions. Hence, Zimmerman emphasizes the interdependency between the diferent levels, these are not to be separated. Even on an individual level, i.e., psychological empowerment, is defned as the \"knowledge and skills necessary to take efective action within sociopolitical context\" [90]. Relating this back to the dimensions provided by Schneider, this implies that one cannot separate power-over from power-to, these are fundamentally interrelated. Zimmerman also observed that most research on empowerment is devoted to the individual level, yet the organizational and community levels are equally important and deserve equal attention. Moreover, a consequent premise of Zimmerman's framework is that we can only learn about how empowerment in rehabilitation, and by extension in a healthcare context such as a school for disabled children, by studying the specifc settings that provide opportunities as well as the broader socio-cultural context in which it takes place. Empowerment must be conceptualized \"differently for specifc contexts and populations\" [90, p. 4].", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_para_10": "Any technology's development can enable some while disabling others.

This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment.

Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities.

Recent studies have proposed the exploitation of sensors integrated with VR platforms (e.g., eye-trackers and motion trackers) to detect users' affective states in real-time [74,97]. Previous studies examining sensor integration have focused on collecting behavioral and physiological data in VR-based data-driven interventions. For example, vrSocial's use of visualization of proximity, voice volume, and speech duration of autistic children in real-time within virtual spaces was an effective way for the children to better regulate their proximity in VR [13]. Another VR-based system correlated children's physiological signals with their affective states while participating in given social tasks, which resulted in a VRbased system that was adaptive to participants' performance [48]. With VR, user data such as voice volume or affective state can be collected while they interact in the virtual environments, while stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, professionals, co-workers) can contribute to the learning process [5,[57][58][59]. Thus, such user-generated data could facilitate information sharing, perspective-taking, and communication among both autistic people and other stakeholders [77].", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_title": "On Looking at the Vagina through Labella", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_para_6": "Initial work from Correll & Heer [7] suggests that people are able to perform a general sort of \"regression by eye\" with simple Gaussian stimuli and a single class of outliers.

After studying corresponding cases, we propose the use of data-driven mark orientations, where marks in a scatterplot are oriented into the direction of the trend, as a potential design choice that relies on regression by eye when the trend in the data is unambiguous and strong, but provides useful guidance when the trend is ambiguous or weak. Unlike a mere superposition of a trend line on top of a scatterplot, such data-driven marks are a kind of weaker \"suggestion\" for a trend direction, and can be ignored more easily when unnecessary or inappropriate.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) can be immersive to such a degree that users sometimes report feeling tactile sensations based on visualization of the touch, without any actual physical contact. This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_metadata": "Authors: Manika Saha, Delvin Varghese, Tom Bartindale, S.

In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_title": "How to get away with cyberattacks: An argumentative approach to cyberattacks\u2019 legitimization by common users", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_8": "The validity of interaction analysis research is mostly achieved through the transparency of research claims [73].

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015). Recently, neural architectures have been shown effective in such a task, whereby minimal feature engineering is required (Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Peters et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Domain adaptation, as a special case for transfer learning, aims to exploit the abundant data of wellstudied source domains to improve the performance in target domains of interest (Pan and Yang, 2010;Weiss et al., 2016). There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain. The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process.

To present the concept, we created a video prototype of the Workplace Playbook VR. The concept presented in the video prototype primarily targeted autistic people to support their work-related social and communication skills. We made this design decision because VR has been shown to be effective for training the social and communication skills of autistic individuals [41]. Those skills are known to be some of the most pressing challenges that autistic people face in workplaces [18,33,65]. However, as we will report in the findings section, our study revealed that such social and communication skills training VR programs have the potential to enforce \"normative behaviors\" on autistic people rather than respect their values and diversity. Moreover, to advance the positive work experiences of autistic employees in workplaces, we found the importance of practicing design interventions not only for neurodiverse people but also for neurotypical co-workers and employees. Therefore, this work ultimately offers VR design spaces of workplace environments for two target groups-autistic people and members of their community and their neurotypical coworkers.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_11": "Our initial intention in developing the concept of Workplace Playbook VR was to help autistic people practice requisite skills for a variety of social situations that could arise in the workplace and discuss challenges and successes together with members of their support network. The spirit of this design was aligned with the findings of past research that have shown the efficacy of VR in training functional skills for autistic individuals [14,16,41,89]. Despite our intended goal, we found that VR technology designed to develop the social and communication skills of autistic people has the potential to be misused to correct their characteristics and enforce normative behaviors from the perspective of a neurotypical society. This finding reveals important design implications that HCI researchers should consider when designing technology to develop autistic people's social communication skills. In Section 6.1, we discuss how such VR systems should be designed to avoid enforcing normative behaviors and promote autistic individuals' self-advocacy and sense of agency in workplaces.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_abstract": "A growing number of organizations are hiring autistic individuals as they start to recognize the value of a neurodiverse workforce. Despite this trend, the lack of support for autistic employees in workplaces complicates their employment. However, little is known about how people around autistic individuals can support them to create pleasant employment experiences. In this work, we develop the concept of the Workplace Playbook VR to investigate how virtual reality (VR) can help autistic people develop their work-related social communication skills in partnership with people in their support network. Using a video prototype to present the concept, we interviewed 28 participants, including 10 autistic people and 18 members of their support networks, which included family members and professionals. Our interviews revealed that the Workplace Playbook VR program can provide common ground for autistic people and members of their support network to participate in more empathetic communication regarding workplace challenges. Despite the benefits, we identified the potential misuse of social communication skills training features of the VR program to correct the personal characteristics of autistic individuals. Furthermore, to cultivate inclusive workplace environments, we found the needs of VR development not only for autistic people but also for neurotypical employees to promote their understanding of autism and empathy toward autistic employees. We suggest VR designs that promote a sense of agency and self-advocacy for autistic employees, and autism awareness and acceptance training for neurotypical employees.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_12": "Furthermore, our interviews revealed the potential for VR to promote neurotypical employees' understanding of autistic employees, and potential applications of VR to cultivate inclusive workplace environments. Although the efforts of neurotypical employees are critical for developing an inclusive workforce, a large body of VR research mostly focuses on building the competencies of autistic employees through training in target skills [16,41,89]. Therefore, we aim to take a step toward investigating how VR designs can better facilitate the understanding of autistic employees at work and ignite a discussion about changing attitudes and policies at work.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_1": "Virtual reality (VR) has been studied as an effective medium to provide vocational support for autistic people, for instance through training in social communication skills for job interviews [89] or job tasks (e.g., money management) [14]. Simulated reality provides an interactive learning environment that enables autistic people to practice skills multiple times in various scenarios [23,92]. Moreover, sensing technologies that measure the behavioral and physiological signals of autistic individuals during VR interactions can personalize VR experiences and provide helpful insight and feedback about their behaviors [13,55]. This rich body of past work, although not specific to work-related settings, has also shown the effectiveness of VR interventions in increasing autistic people's vocational skills [16,41].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_14": "Our findings revealed some occasional misunderstandings among neurotypical employees about autistic employees at work, such as perceiving inadequate eye contact as rude or strict rule adherence as stubborn. Misunderstanding and conflicts can happen because of a lack of understanding about autism [22,54] and autistic people's different ways of thinking and perceiving situations are often invisible [73]. Therefore, we suggest VR designs that allow neurotypical employees to experience invisible differences of autistic employees. Past research has shown that perspective-taking, the act of perceiving situations from the other's perspective, is effective at eliciting empathy, personal distress, and in turn, maximizing motivation to help [38,80]. Therefore, we suggest an immersive and interactive VR simulation that can help neurotypical employees experience their autistic co-workers' various challenges. Using such VR, neurotypical employees could imagine how neurodiverse coworkers would feel in the simulated situation. The various sensing effects, such as distorting the VR screen to simulate dizziness or visualizing fast heartbeats on a VR screen may further help neurotypical employees experience how autistic people might feel differently in specific situations. When designing and implementing VR, researchers should investigate ways of co-designing it with autistic employees to reflect how they actually feel in specific social situations, and how VR can best reflect their thoughts and feelings.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_7": "Beyond its effectiveness in the acquisition of job-related skills, it has been found that immersive VR can be an effective medium for building empathy-the ability to share and understand others' emotions by taking someone else's perspective [8,26,46]. Previous research on VR and empathy has shown that people who underwent a virtual reality experience simulating life events such as becoming homeless were likely to have a positive attitude toward the homeless and present pro-social behaviors (e.g., sign petitions) [37]. Empathy-building among family, professionals, and co-workers is also critical for autistic people to have pleasant work experiences [33]. Building on the previous research, we investigate how VR systems can be designed to successfully mediate communication between autistic people and members of their support network, who can help address whatever issues and concerns autistic individuals may have regarding workplace social situations. Only a few studies have examined the use of VR technologies to facilitate functional communication between autistic people and caregivers (e.g., teachers, family members, and therapists). For example, studies have used a monitoring module that allows caregivers to observe a learner's VR situations in real-time and adjust task levels and scenarios accordingly to provide appropriate feedback [60,75]. In another study, a therapist directly participated in a VR situation as a peer character, providing responses and feedback tailored to the behaviors of autistic people [24].", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_4": "VR has the benefit of providing a safe, controlled environment for autistic individuals to practice social skills without worrying about the negative consequences of making common mistakes associated with face-to-face interactions [1,6,13,16,24]. Furthermore, the flexible and scalable nature of VR can manipulate environments and interactions tailored to autistic people to provide personalized interventions for people with various levels of cognition, language, and social skills [62]. Based on these advantages, VR-based interventions can be applied to a range of domains such as socio-emotional skills [24], safety skills [40,81,82], adaptive skills [49], and communication [24,43].", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_5": "Despite the promising results of previous studies, limitations on VR interventions for autistic people have also been reported [30,47,68]. While previous studies found VR intervention to be effective when acquiring daily living skills [47,63,78], a recent meta-review study pointed out that VR had moderate effects on improving communication skills and emotion regulation skills, perhaps due to the complicated and nuanced nature of these skills [47]. Regarding methodological rigor, results of VR intervention studies are often difficult to validate and generalize due to substantial variations among autistic individuals [40,43,68]. Furthermore, the lack of sufficient precedent and theoretical guidance for VR intervention design and the fact that actual users were not sufficiently involved in the design process were pointed out as limitations [30,68]. This critical view emphasized the importance of understanding the characteristics, needs, and preferences of autistic individuals and stakeholders when designing VR experiences for them [68]. Thus, our research aims to improve the understanding of how VR experiences should be designed to enhance social and communication skills by involving autistic people and members of their support networks in the early stages of VR design. Our work seeks to perform the inclusive, participatory design of VR experiences with and for autistic adults who currently face various challenges in the workplace.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_6": "2.2.1 VR to train employment skills. Several researchers have investigated how VR technologies support autistic individuals to acquire employment skills [14,21]. Employment skills can be divided into two broad categories: job-specific skills called hard skills (e.g., folding, photocopying, and sweeping), and more generic employment-related skills called soft skills (e.g., time management, social skills, and interview skills) [98]. Prior technology-related studies focused more on hard skills rather than soft skills [15], even though autistic people often experience more challenges at work due to their soft skills [33]. Social situations that may arise at work (e.g., working with co-workers, managing conflict, dealing with office politics) have been identified as major challenges that autistic people face in the workplace [65]. Although some studies investigate the use of VR to develop autistic people's soft skills, many focus on learning skills for job interviews such as how to properly communicate and respond in interview situations (e.g., emotional regulatory strategies and self-advocacy methods), use non-verbal communication (e.g., eye contact) when interviewing, and manage attire or hygiene when preparing for an interview [41,64,89,93], rather than on skills related to navigating social situations associated with ongoing employment (e.g., having lunch with co-workers and working with customers). While interview skills are important for obtaining employment, more contextualized and practical support for the everyday social encounters of autistic people in workplaces would further advance their work experience, satisfaction, and success.", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_8": "To foster understanding of an autistic individual, it is important to acquire a wide range of the individual's behavioral data, which can provide a foundation for collaborative reflections between the individual and members of their support network [71,86]. Recent studies have proposed the exploitation of sensors integrated with VR platforms (e.g., eye-trackers and motion trackers) to detect users' affective states in real-time [74,97]. Previous studies examining sensor integration have focused on collecting behavioral and physiological data in VR-based data-driven interventions. For example, vrSocial's use of visualization of proximity, voice volume, and speech duration of autistic children in real-time within virtual spaces was an effective way for the children to better regulate their proximity in VR [13]. Another VR-based system correlated children's physiological signals with their affective states while participating in given social tasks, which resulted in a VRbased system that was adaptive to participants' performance [48]. With VR, user data such as voice volume or affective state can be collected while they interact in the virtual environments, while stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, professionals, co-workers) can contribute to the learning process [5,[57][58][59]. Thus, such user-generated data could facilitate information sharing, perspective-taking, and communication among both autistic people and other stakeholders [77].", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_13": "6.2 VR to Promote Self-advocacy and Sense of Agency for Autistic Employees Bolte et al. [9] called for future research to push the importance of rethinking the way autism is perceived, thus emphasizing the use of words that promote respect and an accurate understanding of autistic people. Researchers have re-conceptualized autism as neurodiversity [27,87], contesting the understanding of independent living or the concept of autonomy. A central premise of neurodiversity is to support self-advocacy and personal autonomy in autistic individuals, allowing them to exert more control over their own lives [51]. To achieve autonomy, one must have functional communication, so any intervention promoting neurodiversity should provide opportunities to express agency and-more importantly-build effective and respectful communication between autistic persons and others in their environment [51]. The concept of agency can be used as an effective framework to understand the social interactions between neurodiverse communication facilitators [79].", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_10": "For the purpose of the video prototype, we visualized turn-taking [67], voice volume [13,67], eye contact [6,42,84], and use of language [11] in the reflection interface, as they have been identified as essential social skills for autistic people [94].

For instance, a recent study examined the co-work experience of eight autistic individuals and neurotypical colleagues across a three-month internship period [76]. For this study, autistic interns were assigned neurotypical \"buddies\" (i.e., mentors) and guided to email their buddies if they had work-related questions.

Studies have shown that a lack of support and accommodations regarding the challenges autistic people encounter at work-such as social communication skills-complicates their successful employment [33,65]. Moreover, the lack of appropriate understanding about autism among employers and co-workers is identified as one of the most common barriers preventing autistic people from finding and retaining employment [22,54].", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_title": "3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_title": "Accessibility of Profile Pictures: Alt Text and Beyond to Express Identity Online", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_para_2": "VR is an ideal playground for the body ownership illusions (see, e.g., [7,51,55,61]).

Several scholars pointed to phenomena of instrumental play that contradict this straightforward definition, leaving the relation between play and voluntari-ness unclear [11,30,46,51]. Our results offer a theoretical model how \"voluntariness\" comes about in and relates to \"play\": The experience of autonomy is a social norm for the type of context people label \"play\" (cf. [57]). As part of (re)producing a play context, people accomplish a sociomaterial setup that strongly affords autonomy. The resulting autonomy experiences lead participants to then recognize and label the situation as \"play\". Conversely, if the setup of a gaming situation affords little autonomy, this experience may lead participants to label it \"work\" and flag it as inappropriate: something that should be autonomous isn't. This model opens to the wider question how labeling or framing and autonomy experience interrelate. For instance, does labeling something as \"play\" increase experienced autonomy?

Prior work shows that lack of airtime subsidy leads to low call volume and engagement [51,62], which causes IVR services to struggle with long-term sustainability [63].

Contrary to these prevailing norms, we designed and deployed Karamad without subsidies, social features, spreading mechanisms, or advertisements.

Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance. In this article we explored a new mechanism for integration focusing on \"inside\" the user's body to design an integration system that reacts to changes in the user's peripheral awareness.", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models"}}

This metric is directly computed from participants' ratings of their chatbot interview experience. This rating can be easily obtained: when piloting an interview chatbot, a question like \"How satisfied are you with the interview experience?\"  [14,23] can be added at the end of an interview session for a participant to report their level of satisfaction. User Trust Rating. This metric measures participants' perceived trust in an interview chatbot. Trust is important because it affects participants' willingness to share information [37]. Similar to obtaining the user satisfaction rating, a question like \"How much do you trust this chatbot? Please rate it on a scale of 1 to 5\" can be added at the end of an interview when piloting an interview chatbot. User Sentiment. This metric evaluates participants' sentiment toward an interview chatbot since such a metric is widely used to measure user satisfaction with interviews/surveys [7]. To obtain user sentiment, one can elicit participants' rationale (why) when eliciting their satisfaction rating and trust rating during pilot interviews. Currently, we use the Vader model [16] to perform sentimental analysis on the collected users responses, and compute the percentages of positive, neutral and negative responses. Level of Empathy. This measures the level of empathy an interview chatbot has since research shows that an empathetic chatbot is able to elicit higher quality responses [65]. Currently, we compute the level of empathy by the frequency of empathetic words used by a chatbot. Specifically, given a conversation segment associated with interview question Q, we normalize the number of empathetic words ( ) over the total number of words within chatbot utterances ( ) in this segment:", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "e54e916259c5ed798f2341c07b67471df6b99d78_title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_4": "Our work on generating design suggestions is also related to various efforts on guiding the design of human-computer interfaces, such as chatbot systems [21] and graphical user interfaces (GUI) [36,68].

One of the drawbacks of this approach lies in its inflexibility of adapting design suggestions to changing design goals or dynamic design issues occurring in real time. On the other hand, Lee et al. use autoencoder and k-nearest neighbor algorithms to recommend GUI design examples that help designers in real time [36]. Moreover, Xu et al. have developed a system that incorporates crowdsourcing to generate design suggestions for GUI designers [68].

Specifically, we have defined a set of metrics to assess a respondent's behavior when engaging with an interview chatbot. Response Length. This metric computes the word count of a respondent's free-text response to an interview question. We chose this metric because previous work indicates that engaged respondents are more willing to give long responses [67]. Designers can use this metric to gauge their chatbot performance and to make corresponding design improvements (e.g., adding follow-up questions or changing a yes/no question to an open-ended question to elicit longer responses). Engagement Duration. This metric indicates how long a participant is willing to engage with an interview question. Although engagement duration alone does not signal the quality of user responses [67], we hope to use it as an indicator of potential issues with an interview question. For example, if the engagement duration of a particular open-ended interview question is exceedingly short, it might signal that the question is too narrow and needs to be rephrased to encourage more open and longer engagement. Completion Rate. This metric computes the percentage of participants completing an interview question or an entire interview. It is a commonly used metric to measure the effectiveness of an interviewer [7,20]. To better help designers improve their chatbots question by question (see Section 6), we compute the completion rate for each interview question (Q) by counting the number of users who completed the question ( ) and the number of users who responded to the question ( ):", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_title": "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "41cea65919caea6b3e1a41a037ac3e624b87b289_title": "Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_title": "Learning to Pronounce Chinese without a Pronunciation Dictionary", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_13": "Before running ANCOVA analyses, we also examined the correlations among all dependent variables.

Tracking asthma related metrics is a significant part of asthma self-management, and this is offered as the main functionality in 79% of 38 reviewed mHealth applications for asthma [6]. Lefco et al. developed an mHealth asthma application which has limited tracking functionality as shown in Fig. 1 [4]. We set our research goal broadly as understanding how to improve the continuity of care for children with asthma. More specifically, given the huge gaps between doctor visits, we look into ways to alleviate the problem of tracking the large amount of data generated and communicating the tracked data effectively to the healthcare provider. We look into the use of visualizations for this purpose specifically for pediatric patients -to investigate whether they can comprehend them, and if so what kind of visualizations are easily understood by them.", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_abstract": "Asthma is a common childhood chronic disease. There are various metrics of asthma which are tracked and reported to healthcare providers. We investigated visualizations & concepts for tracking quantitative and qualitative asthma data for pediatric patients. We conducted a 3-part study with 14 participants where we (1) interviewed 2 parents and 6 children about their health tracking behavior (2) tested visualization alternatives with 6 children (3) designed concepts to track qualitative data for future testing. Our study shows that simple visualizations can be comprehended by children, so the use of these to report data to the healthcare provider is a powerful tool not just for the parents but also pediatric patients. We iterated the design of the visualizations based on qualitative feedback.", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_para_1": "A lot of work has been done with respect to continuity of care for asthma patients. In a 2005 study by Yoos et al., 65% of parents whose children's current symptoms indicated severe asthma reported \"good control\" [8]. Tinschert et al. performed a review of all publicly available asthma management applications on the market and found tracking to be the most common feature functionality offered (79% offered some type of tracking related to asthma) [6]. The same paper suggests the use of virtual coaches, like chatbots to increase long-term engagement with asthma applications. While tools like the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ) have been found to be reliable surrogates in measuring asthma [3,5], there is some level of difference in how these tools evaluate the same symptoms [7].", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor

Both young people and counsellors reflected on how smartphones could be used to identify patterns of emotions and behaviours associated with self-harm. In workshops, young people expressed that they would be generally be comfortable with the idea of behavioural tracking through smartphonebased sensing, and would give access to their relevant personal data for this purpose. Survey respondents also expressed a similar level of comfort with giving access to their data i.e. phone usage time, location, and the type of health website and apps they access. Young people wanted the self-tracking through apps to be as automated as possible; they preferred a passive relationship with the app preferably tracking their behaviours in the background.

EMA research has shown that self-harm engagement is preceded by an increase in negative emotions and followed by a decrease in these same emotions (e.g., [3,6]), lending empirical support to theories that conceptualise self-harm as a form of emotional regulation [43] through a physical 'release' of pain.

However, in some cases the user could benefit from new knowledge derived by the system because the system could be better suited to monitoring and making decisions about certain aspects that the user cannot monitor easily, such as: finding the shortest route to a location, monitoring speed to inform the rider when going too fast, and monitoring air pollution. This notion has opened opportunities for integration systems as follows.

Recent studies have proposed the exploitation of sensors integrated with VR platforms (e.g., eye-trackers and motion trackers) to detect users' affective states in real-time [74,97]. Previous studies examining sensor integration have focused on collecting behavioral and physiological data in VR-based data-driven interventions. For example, vrSocial's use of visualization of proximity, voice volume, and speech duration of autistic children in real-time within virtual spaces was an effective way for the children to better regulate their proximity in VR [13]. Another VR-based system correlated children's physiological signals with their affective states while participating in given social tasks, which resulted in a VRbased system that was adaptive to participants' performance [48]. With VR, user data such as voice volume or affective state can be collected while they interact in the virtual environments, while stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, professionals, co-workers) can contribute to the learning process [5,[57][58][59]. Thus, such user-generated data could facilitate information sharing, perspective-taking, and communication among both autistic people and other stakeholders [77].", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_abstract": "A common task for scatterplots is communicating trends in bivariate data. However, the ability of people to visually estimate these trends is under-explored, especially when the data violate assumptions required for common statistical models, or visual trend estimates are in conflict with statistical ones. In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates."}}

First introduced by Bunescu * Equal contribution. and Pa\u015fca (2006), ED aims to identify the actors involved in human language and, as such, has shown potential in downstream applications like Question Answering (Yin et al., 2016), Information Extraction (Ji and Grishman, 2011;Guo et al., 2013), Text Generation (Puduppully et al., 2019) and Semantic Parsing (Bevilacqua et al., 2021;Procopio et al., 2021).", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_1": "Since the advent of Deep Learning within the NLP community, this task has mostly been framed as a multi-label classification problem (Shahbazi et al., 2019;Broscheit, 2019), especially leveraging the bi-encoder paradigm (Humeau et al., 2020;. However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain.

On the one hand, global models strive to enforce a global coherence across the disambiguations within the same document, leveraging different techniques and heuristics to approximate this objective 2 (Hoffart et al., 2011;Moro et al., 2014;Yamada et al., 2016;Ganea and Hofmann, 2017;Le and Titov, 2018;Yang et al., 2018).", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_3": "On the other hand, local models disambiguate each mention independently of the others, conditioning the entity choice only on the mention and its context. Thanks to the advent of large pretrained language models, this group has recently witnessed a significant improvement in performances, which are nowadays on par with, or even above, those achieved by state-of-the-art global systems (Shahbazi et al., 2019). These approaches usually frame ED as a multi-label classification problem (Broscheit, 2019) and a diverse set of formulations have been proposed. Among these, the bi-encoder paradigm (Bromley et al., 1994;Humeau et al., 2020) has been particularly successful (Gillick et al., 2019;Tedeschi et al., 2021;Botha et al., 2020): here, two encoders are trained to learn vector representations in a shared space for mentions in context and entities, respectively.

Furthermore, the disambiguation involves an auto-regressive decoding that, although mitigated by later efforts (De Cao et al., 2021a), has intrinsic speed limitations. In contrast, here we propose an extractive formulation, where a model receives as input the mention, its context and the text representation of each candidate, and has to extract the span corresponding to the representation of the entity that best matches the (mention, context) pair under consideration. Note that this differs from the aforementioned cross-encoder formulations (Logeswaran et al., 2019; where, instead, each entity was encoded together with the (mention, context) pair, but independently from all the other entities.

And (viii) event properties such as Aspect, Modality, and Polarity that come with the TimeBank dataset and are commonly used as features. The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used.

First, as an entry point into this large dataset, we were interested in understanding the overall nature of the bots requested and created by this community, in particular the issues they address and their technical functionalities. We therefore first conducted a Content Analysis [16,35], inductively coding each submission to capture initial patterns related to (i) the types of topics, issues and tasks users requested or created bots for, and (ii) the types of functionalities and technical features that underpinned requested and created bots. Second, we were interested in the discussions surrounding bots on the Reddit platform. As such, we conducted a Thematic Analysis of all submission and comment data. Following [9], we coded individual submissions and comments, when necessary at the sentence to paragraph level, to summarise content for semantic and latent meaning. Once all data was coded, we compared and contrasted codes, grouped related codes together, and used these as the starting point for creating themes. Finally, we selected exemplar data as evidence of talk underpinning themes to be presented as part of our findings. The coding process across both stages was conducted by three researchers, who regularly met to share codes, discuss different interpretations of data, and to refine codes and subsequent themes.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_6": "At the same time, however, we also saw examples where discussions on Reddit exposed opportunities for engaging with and learning about the underlying software processes through which bots operate. We observed nuanced cocreation processes surrounding proposing, discussing, motivating, releasing and maintaining a bot. We saw the ways in which the suggestion of bot ideas, the receiving of feedback on these ideas from a supportive community of developers, and then the iteration of these through discussion, enabled lay community members to see their initial ideas come to life. We also observed how existing bots became exemplars and prototypes on which new ideas were built. They became ways to peek behind the curtain of bot design and implementation. In some cases this was through watching the trial and error of a creator. In others it was through learning new coding skills themselves via the help and support of more experienced peers. As such, while there was in some cases no exchange of code the interactions observed were akin to forms of legitimate peripheral participation [31] observed in open source communities [13,68] and in situated studies of learning programing skills [13,49]. Therefore, while there were clearly challenges associated with the creation of bot ideas requested by novices, there is great potential to see acts of making bots as sites where the mysterious \u00d2black box\u00d3 of technology can be unpicked and understood. In the following sections we discuss three areas where future work might support such bot making, and reflect on the value of studying bots as a way of understanding online communities.

Cl\u017dment and Guitton [11] categorise bots on Wikipedia into two opposing ideotypes: \u00d4servant\u00d5 bots performing laborious work in place of human volunteers (e.g. correcting grammatical error); and \u00d4policing\u00d5 bots enforcing guidelines and norms. They note how the users of these bots predictably perceive them as servant collaborators under their control, yet users disapprove of \u00d4servant\u00d5 bots unwantedly performing numerous interfering actions across a large number of pages. Furthermore, \u00d4policing\u00d5 bots are perceived to be limiting and constraining, making contributors feel as though bots were aggressively controlling purportedly voluntary decisions. This tension and potential conflict between human and bot editors on Wikipedia has been explored by Geiger both in terms of how bots fit within established roles [18] and what happens where bots that perform vital roles fail [19].", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_0": "Social media platforms have recently seen a proliferation of automated software agents, known as bots, which can monitor and participate in simple online communication. The current scale of online bot activity is remarkable, with bots being responsible for 24% of all activity on Twitter [54]. While their purpose on social media varies widely, bots are characterized by routine behaviours that often respond to other activity according to some designed criteria. For instance, if someone used the phrase \u00d2illegal immigrant\u00d3 on Twitter in July 2015, they might have received an automated reply from \u00d2@DroptheIBot\u00d3 [24] suggesting they rethink on their terminology and use the term \u00d2undocumented immigrant\u00d3 instead. Bots deployed on social media platforms are often quick to gain notoriety. Through these platforms\u00d5 low barriers to social interaction, bots propagate news [34] and political opinion [8]; they counter, respond to and correct statements made by users (such as @DroptheIBot); they name and shame users based on the things they say or content they share [47]; help users appeal parking tickets without needing lawyers [61]; publish generative art (e.g. @MothGenerator); give directions to mysterious places [28]; and attempt humour (e.g @AmIRiteBot). Outside of social media, bots are also an established feature of communities such as Wikipedia, Slack and Reddit, where they provide ways to automate the standard protocols that govern platform content and perform other tasks that are time-consuming for human administrators [11,33,36,52]. However, poor design and implementations of bots can have negative effects. Microsoft\u00d5s Tay Twitter bot [42] was quickly pulled when, influenced by mischievous human peers, it began to post highly offensive racist, sexist and homophobic material. Bots gained further notoriety in expos\u017ds of the dating site Ashley Madison in which it was revealed that many customer interactions with seemingly real users were, in fact, with bots [32].! The recent proliferation of bots has been supported by the development of new tools and services which have lowered barriers to their creation and deployment. The availability of simple, well-documented application programming interfaces (APIs) that support ever more accessible languages and frameworks opens bot creation to novice developers. Meya [63], Labnol [3] and \u00d2Cheap Bots Done Quick\u00d3 [60] provide tools that allow non-developers to design, create and deploy simple bots without writing a line of code. The Weavrs platform gained widespread notoriety [2] for facilitating the creation, at the press of a button, of relatively unsophisticated but strikingly effective and subversive Twitter bots seeded with existing profiles of real celebrities. A recent well-publicised online tutorial describing \u00d2How to Make a Twitter Bot in Under an Hour: Even if you don\u00d5t code that often!\u00d3 [43] contributes to an expanding set of reference material regarding the process of making bots. Furthermore, events such as \u00d2Bot Summit\u00d3 [27] and \u00d2Art of Bots\u00d3 [59]) offer bot-making enthusiasts opportunities to talk about bots, collaboratively make them, swap expertise and offer help.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

Likewise, Larsson and Moe [30] note the need for researchers and platform developers to deepen their understandings of how bot accounts influence and propagate news and media distribution. Relatedly, Savage et al [48] present an approach for using Twitter bots as a mechanism for calling volunteers to action around social causes, highlighting the ease with which changing the tone of the language expressed by a bot can influence engagement from human social media users [48].

This included little understanding of the technical fundamentals of bots; budding botsmiths did not appreciate the additional infrastructure required to host and operate bots, nor understand the most basic of programming and networking competencies required to realise their idea. There were also issues around the possibilities and limitations of the APIs that serve as the lifeblood of any bot. In addition to these technical matters, there were issues of expectation around richness of interaction, such as a bots\u00d5 ability to understand context or subtleties of language, perhaps in part due to the cultural mythology that surrounds robots and artificial intelligence [55]. This speaks to wider contemporary issues where the public have little awareness or understanding of the software processes that shape and constrain the things we see online [9]. In many respects, these raise deep concerns about the potential to engage wider publics in probing and questioning the roles software agents play in society.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_7": "As reported, there were many examples where those who were proposing bots struggled to express their ideas, could not elaborate on initial propositions, or simply had a very limited knowledge of what was technically feasible. There is potential here, however, for exploring the ways in which online environments might be designed or reconfigured to support the expression of ideas around software agents. Inspiration might be found here in literature that has examined the ways in which other online platforms support exchanges of knowledge and advice between expert and novice coders [26]. For example, Asaduzzaman et al [5] have examined why requests for help get left unresolved on platforms like StackOverflow\u00d1they highlight that those questions that are \u00d4too short, unclear, vague or hard to follow\u00d5, too specific or perceived to involve too much work often get ignored. Contrastingly, Nashei et al [38] highlight that good questions on the same platform tend to encourage continued discussion where the initial problem gets redefined. Similarly, those responses that work best tend to be those that are concise, refer back to the question asked, highlight key elements, and provide step-by-step instructions and explore multiple solutions. Furthermore, studies of expert online communities of programmers have highlighted the importance of timely responses, both from those asking a question and those proposing answers [40].", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_8": "While a significant amount of collaborative practice around design in HCI orientates itself towards enabling conditions where participants can be open-minded [15], withhold judgement [56] and imagine radically different futures [14], in many respects the opposite issue is the matter of concern here. The challenge was to shape requesters\u00d5 ideas in ways to fit their imaginations to the capabilities of simple bots. It is often claimed that digital technologies can be \u00d2black boxes\u00d3 that are \u00d4impermeable, inflexible, and unviewable\u00d5 [37]. Indeed, consumer products are critiqued for creating conditions where these hidden innards disable people from appropriating, re-making and engaging in their own practices of design [53]. Therefore, we might take inspiration from attempts to support DIY practices around maker technologies and kits for experimentation with input and output platforms [53]. Simple tools that provide exemplar functions and types of data that act as bot \u00d2building blocks\u00d3 might offer a starting point for guided experimentation. One way of doing so might be to present already existing and typical designs that require completing (as suggested by [44]) through adding or taking away component blocks that represent specific functionality. In doing so, we might more carefully scaffold learning through safe experimentation, and also extend the current positive examples we saw where exemplar bots would be used as a starting point to inspire or ideate a new bot creation by more novice users.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_21": "As we pointed out in Section 2.3, our investigation concentrated on reaction mechanisms rather than affordances. Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_para_3": "Perhaps unsurprisingly, significant amounts of research on bots has focused on preventing them being used in the first place.

Others have studied bots to develop tools to understanding the propagation of SPAM on social media [57], and have developed techniques to detect bots based on content of tweets [10] and comparing bot-based accounts to those operated by humans [1]. This has led to the development of tools such as BotOrNot [12] which aids social media users to distinguish whether an account is operated by a person or an automated agent; and \u00d2Stweeler\u00d3, which supports the analysis of the impact and influence of bots on Twitter [20].", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational.

Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116]. Besides these moderation rules, we also use the \"nest level\" of a comment as a control.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

Two coders labelled 4,500 unique comments with at least one of the thirteen types of essential components extracted from our theoretical analysis (see label development documentation in Section 3.4 and Appendix B). To ensure intercoder reliability and the representativeness of the sample, we performed the following procedures. First, coders discussed the developed minimal theoretic conceptualization, reviewed predefined examples for each class, and resolved any questions about the nature of the classes. Then, both coders labelled the same set of 100 random comments from the corpus, yielding a Krippendorf alpha of 0.7. After discussing prevailing differences in the coding tactics, coders learned to adjust their coding in a way that conformed more to the theoretic framework. Coders then relabelled the same corpus, yielding an intercoder reliability of 0.75. This was higher than the expected minimum for coding complicated language tasks in the literature (>0.6 -see e.g., [5,37,43,92,105,122]). Since coders' labeling practices were robust, they proceeded with the selection and labeling of further comments. Specifically, an initial sample of 1650 comments was labeled, containing 30 comments from each subreddit in the dataset. Next, a second batch of 1000 comments was annotated, which we randomly selected by stratified sampling among subreddits. To assess how many comments were necessary for an accurate classifier, we trained a preliminary language model on these 2750 comments, finding that for reliable prediction for each class, at least 300 observations were necessary.

First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse.

First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent.

However, they have also become common places for users to engage in hateful [86] and low-credibility political rhetoric [124]. Social media platforms are not simply digital representations of offline political activity. They are key spaces for articulation, organization, and implementation of political action [27]. Indeed, they are not intermediaries of communication processes, but function as their curators [51]. When billions of people interact in a common space, a platform's design has enormous power over the production, mediation, and dissemination of user discussions. A platform's choice of communication reaction mechanisms (i.e., \"likes,\" \"upvotes/downvotes\" etc.) and its recommendation algorithms critically influence the nature of user interactions on the platform. On the one hand, such reaction mechanisms -as means of evaluation -condition what type of information users produce, and, on the other hand, recommendation algorithms determine what information users will come to interact with [23,76,90,93].", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_10": "In this section, we reflect on the results of our work, its limitations, and the research opportunities in crowdsourcing.

Prior work shows that lack of airtime subsidy leads to low call volume and engagement [51,62], which causes IVR services to struggle with long-term sustainability [63]. Successful IVR forums have also engaged and retained users through social features (e.g. voting and comments) [49,62], spreading mechanisms such as the ability to forward content to friends [49,50], incentivized referrals [61], and advertisements [41]. Contrary to these prevailing norms, we designed and deployed Karamad without subsidies, social features, spreading mechanisms, or advertisements.

In so doing, children tend to attribute psychological states and reasoning to anything that appears self-controlled to them. By engaging in the pretense that an agent is alive and interacting with them, children develop, train, and make sense of their understanding of agency, parsing an agent's interaction in a social context. Therefore, conversing through and with CUIs about the future could surface children's tacit knowledge of the agency of a CUI, stimulate sense-making and wishes about future technologies [88], thereby supporting co-design these technologies [85].

Specifically, the iterative design of an interview chatbot is to fulfill two main goals. First, like designing any user interviews or surveys [7,42], designers of an interview chatbot need to ensure the effective design of an interview task (e.g., proper and clear wording of questions). Second, like building any conversational agents [29], designers of an interview chatbot need to make sure that the chatbot can successfully carry out such an interview task [65].", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_para_9": "Taking inspiration from artist Jae Rhim Lee's \"green burial\" initiative with specialized mushrooms, we present a design fction conversation that features a present self that talks to a set of future fowers, which grow from one's buried body. Human bodies accumulate toxic waste and after we die, our \"return\" to nature can thus be harmful. To combat this, a mushroom suit is said to decompose one's body safely by removing or neutralizing toxicity. 9 Hence, the conversation combines the topics of self-identity and climate change. For feasibility, the character \"Flo\" in the conversation below represents a set of 3D printed fowers ( Figure 5), which are added to smart speakers. They are analogous to the Alias technology, which is a 3D printable \"parasite\" (depicted in Figure 6) that can be added on top of a smart speaker to create a \"hacked\" CUI, This can stop smart speakers from listening in on conversations when they are not in use. In addition, Alias can help people to rename their smart speakers without losing their functionality, allowing users to utter custom \"wake words\" or sounds instead of default names, such as \"Hey, Alexa\". For our exploration, we imagine that 3D-printable and customizable fowers would be added to smart speakers; these fowers can talk to present-day people about how and why they grow from human bodies. As discussed above, design fction and speculative design are approaches that could help to shape how interactions with CUIs can be designed. A fctional conversation for this exploration is below (as written by the frst author): We explored a diferent use case for CUIs, as a starting point to challenge our habits. As Refowering Self suggests, we can trigger people's critical refection towards behavioral change by directly involving one's present and future selves. Flo is foremost sharing \"our\" side of the story in its version of the future, i.e., 'sharing advice' [70], rather than directly preaching to a person about what to do. Its repeated use of \"us\", \"our\", \"we\", i.e., as frstperson plural pronouns, takes on a tone of solidarity between our present and future selves, as a message on how \"we are in the together\". The emphasis, again, is in juxtaposing diferent temporal dimensions as an experience that CUIs can foster, which is what prior research has not looked into. Such ludic experiences focus less on sustainable behavior as a \"to-do list\", cf. [72], but as refective conversations in our everyday lives with CUIs.

Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy.

Participatory Design (PD) approaches offer one way in which teachers can be directly involved in the design of classroom technologies, however PD processes alone fail to address the challenges of integrating technology within existing practices. In this paper we propose co-teaching as a novel form of co-design practice. We describe a two year longitudinal Co-Teaching project resulting in the development and use of three digital designs for the classroom. Using the TPACK model to guide our reflections we offer insights into the ways that co-teaching can support the design and integration of educational technologies. We suggest that co-teaching as a form of co-design practice offers a way to move teachers from passive adopters of technology to active participants in the design and integration of educational technologies.", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_14": "In this paper we conceptualize co-teaching as a form of design practice and suggest it as a suitable method for the design of educational technology. Co-teaching, through its embedded and situated approach to design and evaluation, offers the potential to reduce some of the known tensions within co-design practices in the classroom. It offers a method of design practice specifically for use in the educational technology field and as such is a suitable method to consider the unique challenges of designing technology for the classroom. Alongside ensuring teachers remain active in the design process, we suggest it also offers a potential way of supporting the development of teachers' (and arguably designers') TPACK, something known to support integration of educational technology in the classroom [30]. Co-design as a design practice specifically encourages collaboration between stakeholders with a particular emphasis on the sharing of relevant expertise. The user is positioned as an expert of their experience while the researcher or designer offers tools for ideation as well as technological knowledge [83]. Co-teaching, meanwhile is traditionally a term used to define the practice of two teachers working collaboratively to teach a class and is often used as a method of teacher training e.g. [37,77]. It facilitates the creation of student-centered environments as well as supporting successful school improvement programs through its focus on collaborative reflection and action [61].

For example, Tsai and Chi [97] suggest that a lack of design thinking skills poses a third-order barrier to integrating technology into their practices. Considering technology in a more 'designerly' way [14], then, might encourage teachers to appropriate it into their practices [41], something supported by McKenney et al. who suggest that co-design can be used as a way of supporting teachers to develop design skills [56].", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_12": "Where co-design has been conducted with teachers in the wider educational technology domain, researchers have demonstrated that co-designing new science curricula with teachers offers benefits including a substantial effect on the adoption of the technological tools and the curriculum [20], while other researchers recognized the value of including teachers' expertise in the process [87]. Roschelle et al. suggest that key considerations for co-designing with teachers include creating a \"concrete, tangible innovation challenge\", investigating \"current practice and classroom contexts\", and involving \"central accountability for the quality of the products of the co-design\" [80]. One area where co-design with teachers is becoming more prevalent and methods are often discussed explicitly is in the learning analytics field, specifically with a renewed interest in the application of human-centered design approaches to the design of learning analytics tools, e.g., [2,35,58,99].", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_para_11": "Although there are a number of reported benefits to including teachers in the co-design process, there are relatively few instances in HCI literature of teachers participating in co-design processes, with literature more often reporting engagement with students or parents [51].

While these papers all report on studies that resulted in artefacts that were successfully aligned with classroom practices as a result of co-design processes, the papers themselves primarily focus on the evaluation of these artefacts within their given context.

Utilizing co-teaching as a method in this project allowed the researcher to understand the impact of context on teachers' enacted practices and how these differed from the ones described at the beginning of the design process.

Longitudinal co-design processes that include teachers in the design and evaluation of educational technologies in the classroom are one way that this could be explored. There are however some well-reported tensions in the co-design process when used in an educational setting. For example, teachers and designers often have different criteria for evaluating the success of co-design processes [88]. Teachers often see researchers' solutions as too theoretical and not suited to real life classrooms [22,54] while researchers often view teachers' limited knowledge of technology as a barrier to effectively contributing to design processes [88], which points to a need for more engaged and embedded design practices. It is clear from previous literature that successful co-design requires teachers to feel their ideas are respected and that there is an \"atmosphere of trust and inclusion\" in co-design partnerships [13].

From earlier research on the use of and barriers to DIY technologies, we already learned about the challenges with respect to efort expectancy and the lack of facilitating conditions [77], the lack of alignment with clinical practice [37], the time-consuming process of confguration and adding content due to openness of DIY toolkits [52], and the lack of representation of end-users in the design [11], resulting in design for others [56]. Our fndings echo and reinforce these fndings, and further articulate the problems in institutional settings, injecting dependencies that cannot be met, and demanding resources from already overburdened staf. In this situation, expecting that actors engage in slow-paced technology exploration and tinkering is problematic; instead, our fndings regarding the use of velcro, masking tape, and magnets suggest that quick, nondigital, and iterative adaptation is preferred, echoing fndings by Hofmann et al. [37]. Such solutions would also facilitate adaptations in the periphery of user attention, while allowing teachers to maintain their active presence for the remainder of the class group. Considering our fndings on staf burden, the model of online communities sharing with and learning from each other to create DIY assistive technology, as pushed forward in earlier research [40,57] also seems less feasible. Likewise, practices of sharing through researchers, introducing or delivering time-limited support, should be examined through the lens of 'gifting', suggesting these actions may come at a cost: the school is no longer seen as a autonomous actor but becomes a recipient in need of help.", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_11": "Critical awareness of the socio-political environment. The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59].

Ways of integrating off-the-shelf digital technologies in the classroom have been explored at length in the educational technology community with professional development suggested as one of the most important aspects that leads to greater acceptance and use of technology in the classroom, particularly that which enhances a teacher's self-efficacy [85]. Various models exist that offer ways to consider offering professional development for teachers such as the 'train the teacher model' or the 'flipped PD' model [78,108]. Both these models separate research and professional development encouraging professional development as a route to embedding technology created as part of theory-driven processes. Rather than see professional development as a hurdle to overcome to ensure effective technology integration within the classroom, we saw research and professional development happening alongside one another throughout the development and evaluation of digital technologies. Such co-teaching practices allow us to more readily explore theorydriven but practice-oriented approaches to educational technology research, something that has been called for in the educational technology field [72].

Despite the possible benefits of using educational technology in the classroom, successfully integrating it into teachers' practices long term remains an ongoing challenge [66]. It is thought that there are a number of barriers to successful integration, both extrinsic barriers such as access to technology and training, as well as intrinsic barriers such as teachers' pedagogical beliefs and established classroom practices [22,73]. Tondeur et al. suggest one of the biggest challenges is understanding the interaction between teachers' pedagogical beliefs and their use of digital technology [73].

TK is discussed in the findings in relation to confidence as it is suggested that TK is not improved by technology knowledge alone but rather influenced by the other factors including self-efficacy about their technology knowledge [1]. One way in which surveys have measured self-efficacy is to consider confidence as a way of understanding teachers' applied self-efficacy in the classroom [40].

Our work suggests that the potential of DIY assistive technology (and technology as such) to empower disabled students needs to be understood in the context of all interconnected levels of empowerment defned by Zimmerman and colleagues. Here, we want to draw attention to our observations that highlight how direct interactions with technology occur at the individual level (e.g., a student using a smart screen, or a teacher trying to set up a laptop), but are mediated by the environment (e.g., a student who uses a wheelchair being unable to reach the smart screen because the classroom is too small, or a teacher not managing to make peripheral devices work because of poorly serviced laptops) which is shaped by decisions taken by the wider organisation (e.g., the decision to no longer have therapists help teachers with transfers of students), which again is shaped by decisions in the broader community (e.g., the amount of funding available to the school leading to staf shortages, and housing the school in an inadequate building). Likewise, empowerment processes at the school were neither one of the individual student, nor one of the individual teacher or therapist, nor tied to one specifc time or location. We found that in the observed environment, therapy and teaching blended. Consequently, empowerment is interwoven and arises from the dynamic interactions, between the level of individual (the child, the teacher and the therapist) and the school as organisation, and the societal level. We hypothesize that because interactions with technology are primarily visible at the individual level, it is a natural consequence to focus research eforts on this clearly defned part, similar to how we originally articulated our research goal of leveraging maker technologies to support therapists and teachers at school, and to empower students, and likewise similar to previous HCI and accessibility research (e.g., see [2,57,76]).

These scenarios are characterized as situations in which the process is constantly moving horizontally and vertically between and within diverse micro-meso and macro levels [58] and call for attention to the significant relationships between policy, institutions, and meta-cultural frames [58,115]. PD approaches in social computing are figured by a diverse group of institutions, and need to be understood in terms of the meso-and macro-level institutions that PD is dependent on and informed by [58]. Dearden and colleagues [33] also acknowledged the need to understand the institutioning involved in critical computing issues. In the debate on HCI and social innovation, they also contribute to the insufficiently studied issue of HCI designers' lack of attention past the research context to how innovations become distributed and adopted for social goods.

We suggest that this problem also be brought to the table when doing such as designing a nutrition program with the local community.

Moreover, adding screens to outdoor play (a coding platform running on a tablet device) is thought to interfere with natural play patterns [34] and compromise the benefits of natural play [44]. Nonetheless, the children successfully bridged this gap, using the \"heads down\" coding activity to create code that generates a \"heads up\" outdoor game experience. In addition, children played their games with their friends with no further adjustments to the code, indicating that they were able to program playable outdoor games. This may be attributed to the clear distinction between the coding platform and the digital device, that framed the coding platform as a tool for defining the game and the device as a tool for playing the game. Future work should test this assumption and compare the digital coding platform to a more tangible coding platform. While physical programming may preserve the \"heads up\" nature of outdoor play, it may also be perceived as part of the game instead of a mechanism for defining the game rules.", "978c06878c5381caefc6e9dec2c49239ae7f8bd4_title": "GRIDS: Interactive Layout Design with Integer Programming", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "e6f52716129165ef1c97da9f08de1644bed04cb2_title": "Touch+Finger: Extending Touch-based User Interface Capabilities with \"Idle\" Finger Gestures in the Air", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_abstract": "Outdoor play is in decline, including its benefits to children's development.

We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device, enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas, coding them, and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study, 24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones, enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements, integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code, and were excited to see their code come to life.

Changes to the field of view in peripheral awareness have been linked with quality of human performance. This instinctive narrowing of vision that occurs as a threat is perceived has implications in activities that benefit from the user having a wide field of view, such as cycling to navigate the environment. We present \"Ena\", a novel EEG-eBike system that draws from the user's neural activity to determine when the user is in a state of peripheral awareness to regulate engine support. A study with 20 participants revealed various themes and tactics suggesting that peripheral awareness as a neurological state is viable to align human-machine integration with internal bodily processes. Ena suggests that our work facilitates a safe and enjoyable human-computer integration experience.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_4": "Take away: HCI Practitioners can re-use the implementation description and the code offered along with the equipment listed to study changes in the user's field of view via EEG in real-time during interaction. This is important, as changes to our field of view affects how much we see, and can influence thinking processes that enhance or hinder creativity [25,34] and affect human performance [14,29]. As such, we invite HCI practitioners to use peripheral awareness as a neurological state to better understand how we can support human performance in other areas within HCI, such as: health and wellbeing, critical systems, sports, and creative and collaborative work, to name just a few. Prior work in human-computer integration showed works focusing on \"on\" the user's body [3,26], to react to bodily actions, and \"around\" the user's body [4,18,59], to react to external data to support human performance. In this article we explored a new mechanism for integration focusing on \"inside\" the user's body to design an integration system that reacts to changes in the user's peripheral awareness.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_5": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use changes in a user's field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a mechanism for integration. We suggest that they should consider how the integration system extends the user's abilities in the contexts of the experience. Using EEG to monitor neural activity can offer access to a user's preattentive processing state, resulting in possibilities for integration where the system responds to a situation \"before\" the user can with their body. This offers design alternatives relating to the user and the system using their sensing capabilities to complement each other. We chose kinetic feedback [12,60], as this would keep the user's eye sight free so they could focus on experiencing the system, their body and the surroundings. This enabled users to concentrate on the sensation afforded by reaching peripheral awareness, which made the eBike go faster and resulted in a kinetic feedback loop.", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_2": "These studies show that human-computer integration in an exertion context has focused on systems that can react to the user's actions (focusing \"on\" the user's body -e.g., [3,26]), and on the user's environment (focusing \"around\" the user's body -e.g., [4,17,59]), to support and facilitate new user experiences. What appears to be missing in this vibrant design space is systems that draw from the \"inside\" of the user's body to explore inner bodily processes as mechanisms of integration. As a result, we consider changes to the field of view relating to peripheral awareness as a valuable mechanism for integration between the user and the system as it is linked with human performance [32,44,45].", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_8": "These contributions are targeted to the agendas of Human-Computer Integration [21,22] due to the insights resulting from studying peripheral awareness as a mechanism of integration; Trustable and Explainable AI [52], due to the tactics offered to promote trust when designing integration systems that can automatically act on the experience; and Inbodied Design, due to the focus on the internal bodily processes to inform HCI design [5,57].", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_para_6": "Take away: Our work suggests that HCI practitioners can use kinetic feedback for peripheral awareness integration over mechanisms such as screen notifications, sounds, and haptics, because the user can remain attentive to the experience, rather than having to switch their attention to receive feedback via other sensory inputs, which, in turn, could affect the integration experience. This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_title": "Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_title": "Towards Sustainable ICTD in Bangladesh: Understanding the Program and Policy Landscape and Its Implications for CSCW and HCI", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "5d3409e586ffaecdccf3c354533935baad48b3a1_title": "Magnetact: magnetic-sheet-based haptic interfaces for touch devices", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_metadata": "Authors: Manika Saha, Delvin Varghese, Tom Bartindale, S.

We now draw from augmentation [55] with its goal to create human-machine technologies that provide us with an extension of our own abilities. This quote from our study depicts this situation: \"It feels as all of a sudden that you've activated a different part of your senses, of your vision, that you didn't know you had access to.\" This suggests that the user's abilities were augmented through our system. Finally, we draw from integration [21], which implies that both, human and machine, can draw meaning around each other's actions to work in a partnership. This quote from our study depicts this situation: \"I felt like the system was cycling with me and slowed us down when the situation ahead changed.\" This suggests that it was perceived as if the user and the system were working in a partnership. In summary, it appears that users progressed from interaction to augmentation as steps on a continuum towards reaching a partnership state of human-machine integration rather than simply reaching a state of integration from the start.", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_metadata": "Authors: Teresa Almeida, R.

However, people frequently lack valuable knowledge about at least one application, especially as software changes and new software emerges. Existing help systems either lack contextual knowledge or are tightly-knit into a single application. We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources and demonstrate it through the RePlay system. RePlay uses accessibility APIs to gather context about the user's activity. It leverages an existing search engine to present relevant videos and highlights key segments within them using video captions. We report on a week-long field study (n=7) and a lab study (n=24) showing that contextual assistance helps people spend less time away from their task than web video search and replaces current video navigation strategies. Our findings highlight challenges with representing and using context across applications.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_2": "We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources. We embody this approach in the RePlay system, which enables users to search for learning videos based on their application usage. RePlay gathers application context using system accessibility apis. It extends online video search and cues videos to relevant segments based on their captions. We focus on video assistance because despite video's growing popularity (Cisco predicts that by 2021, 82% of all internet traffic will be video [2]), searching and browsing video remain cumbersome [25,39,40]. Video is popular for content creators as it is often easier to author than tutorials or diagrams (which require careful curation). Learners value video for its efficacy in communicating complex or continuous visual actions such as brushing or setting parameters [10]. However, interacting with videos remains difficult because they are harder to navigate and scan for steps than text [10].", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_9": "Finding clips and re-ranking videos. Several techniques automatically extract instructional video clips from screencasts of software use. The dominant approach leverages application usage [10,20,29,52], requiring that the video be recorded in an instrumented version of the software. Alternatively, computer vision can detect tool-selection events [32,41], even without prior knowledge about the specific software [5]. To be application-independent and embed online videos directly without waiting to download and process them, RePlay instead uses metadata and caption text to rank and segment videos.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_7": "Automatically dividing videos into conceptual chunks can improve peoples' ability to find useful information for their task [5,10,19,32,36,41]. RePlay uses captions to select relevant clips [17,39,40]. Automatic clip selection plays a limited but growing role in web search. Google displays a \"suggested video clip\" [48] as the automated summary for some searches, and Bing's \"smart motion preview\" feature [1] shows a 30-second preview for video search results. In contrast, RePlay focuses on searching with and presenting results within application context. Chi et al. [10] showed people benefit most from a mix of text and video; RePlay combines video and text instruction by presenting captions with videos for both navigational and learning assistance.", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_5": "Bringing learning resources directly into applications reduces the need for context switching. For example, proactively recommending content in-situ based on user context can lead users to resources they might not have even thought to search for [11,16,23,32,35].

RePlay demonstrates this approach using video; different activities (e.g., programming) may benefit from other types of content (e.g., text resources). RePlay could naturally be extended to any textual content (or content with textual metadata). Text results could be displayed as short summaries with clickable keywords to expand more detail [13]. For detecting context, RePlay used MacOS's accessibility api; other oss (e.g. Windows [34]) also have similar apis. Beyond software, RePlay's approach could extend to any domain for which online videos are abundant (e.g., physical building tasks). To detect activity context, one could augment physical tools with sensors [31,46] or track body poses with wearable sensors or computer vision. A challenge for future work is to convert sensor or vision data into text searches, or to index videos using the sensor or vision data directly.", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_para_8": "Methods for navigating between video segments include interactive timeline markers [5,20,24,25,32], thumbnail images [5,10,19,24,40,41], transcript text [24], and clickable elements overlaid on the video [36].

We use timeline markers over other options as they take up little space and allow for pop-up text previews, which aid browsing.

In-task help for a specific goal is one of the biggest reasons people seek web [27] and video [4] tutorials. However, tutorials tend to show a full task from start to finish, much of which may not be relevant to the user's current goal. This leaves it to the user to both find a relevant tutorial and locate the segment(s) within it that contains the needed information. Effectively searching the Web is an acquired skill; coming up with the right keywords and search settings can be difficult, especially for novices [44]. In addition, web search environments lack context that human tutors use to proactively offer help and tailor feedback [45]. Adding contextual terms automatically to search queries (e.g., os version, application, recently-used tools) can help improve the relevance and utility of search results without requiring the user to know app-specific terminology [7,13,33].

However, very recent empirical studies show that some self-attention heads make little contribution and can be pruned as redundant heads. This work takes a novel perspective of identifying and then vitalizing redundant heads. We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads.

We evaluate the performance of applying our method on the low-and high-level encoder layers in the next section, and obtain the best performance when applying on the first encoder layer.

Our model, which is based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) text generation model, is fine-tuned simultaneously for both reranking (in order to improve the precision of the top retrieved passages) and extracting the answer. Unlike previous work, monoQA makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task, followed by the other tokens for the answer extraction task, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Our contributions are summarised as follows: (1) we leverage Multi-Task Learning with a text generation model by sharing the reranker and reader's learned structure to effectively addresses the ORConvQA task; (2) using two different ORConvQA datasets, we compare our model to two strong baselines from the literature, and show that our MTL reranker and generative reader approach yields the best F1, Recall, MRR, Figure 2: An example dialog and relevant passages from the ORConvQA dataset (Qu et al., 2020). and MAP performance improvements over the strongest baseline with statistically significant improvements ranging from +5.70% to +23.34%; (3) the proposed MTL model combining the reranker and generative reader significantly outperforms and is twice as fast for inference than the individual application of the monoT5 and UnifiedQA models for reranking and extracting the answer.", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_4": "Language model pre-training (Bengio et al., 2003;Peters et al., 2018;Radford et al., 2018;Devlin et al., 2019) is another line of self-supervised learning task.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4.

Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving method proposed in computer vision on the Transformer-based language model, and further improve it by proposing a novel method, advanced knowledge for large model\u2019s initialization. In addition, a two-stage learning method is proposed to further accelerate the pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments on representative PLMs (e.g., BERT and GPT) and demonstrate that (1) our method can save a significant amount of training cost compared with baselines including learning from scratch, StackBERT and MSLT; (2) our method is generic and applicable to different types of pre-trained models.

They start pre-training a small model with fewer Transformer layers, and then iteratively expand the model by stacking the already trained layers on the top. Another line of work proposes to \"back distill\" the knowledge of the small models into large models, which is termed as knowledge inheritance (Qin et al., 2021). Some works focus on the data effi-ciency (Wu et al., 2021) and take notes for rare words during the pre-training process to help the model understand them when they occur next.

Then word alignment is used to find mappings between source and target words, so that source syntactic dependencies can be projected to the target translations. Following, a postprocessing step is applied by removing unaligned target words, in order to ensure that the resulting target syntax forms a valid dependency tree, The method has shown promising performance for unsupervised cross-lingual dependency parsing among transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011;T\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et al., 2012;Rasooli and Collins, 2015;Guo et al., 2016b). * Corresponding author.  The treebank translation method, however, suffers from various sources of noise. For example, machine translation errors directly affect the resulting treebank, by introducing ungrammatical word sequences. In addition, the alignments between source and target words may not be isomorphic due to inherent differences between languages or paraphrasing during translation. For example, in the case of Figure 1, the English words \"are\" and \"being\", and the Swedish word \"med\", do not have corresponding word-level translation. In addition, it can be perfect to express \"as soon as they can\" using \"very quickly\" in a translation, which looses word alignment information because of the longer span. Finally, errors in automatic word alignments can also bring noise.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours.

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

source and target distributions appear as similar as possible has benefited transfer learning tasks across several applications. Generally it requires labeled data from the source and only unlabeled data from the target to learn such representations. While these representations act like a bridge to transfer knowledge learned in the source to the target; they may lead to negative transfer when the source specific characteristics detract their ability to represent the target data. We present a novel neural network architecture to simultaneously learn a two-part representation which is based on the principle of segregating source specific representation from the common representation. The first part captures the source specific characteristics while the second part captures the truly common representation. Our architecture optimizes an objective function which acts adversarial for the source specific part if it contributes towards the cross-domain learning. We empirically show that two parts of the representation, in different arrangements, outperforms existing learning algorithms on the source learning as well as cross-domain tasks on multiple datasets.", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_para_2": "Reusable Neural Network.

There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain. The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process.

This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_para_3": "Manipulation of the illusory touch was performed using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

Using state-of-the-art VR (with a head-mounted display and accurate hand tracking), two VR scenes where participants experienced the illusory touch were created. In the active scene, participants actively touched a virtual object (ball) using their bare hands.

VR scenes are mostly being perfected and examined in the visual domain, but engagement of other senses is also highly favorable for the design of immersive VR experiences. Classic approach to sense stimulation in VR consists of attaching a display to the relevant sensing organ [30]. Although this is effective for stimulation of vision and hearing (senses with relatively small sensing organs), it is much more difficult problem to stimulate the surface of the skin, the largest organ on the human body [8]. Recently, alternative approaches to haptic interfaces emerged, including electrical muscle stimulation [34,35].

To a great degree, current VR systems, being predominantly visual, depend on this effect. The second reason for emergence of the illusory touch is the way how the human brain constructs bodily representation. Information from the senses are integrated in the brain to form plausible (internally consistent) representation of own body [24]. It has been revealed that the multisensory integration process can be manipulated to create altered perception of the self. One of the earliest experiments demonstrating malleability of the bodily representation is known as the rubber hand illusion [6]. In the rubber hand illusion, simultaneous haptic stimulation of a participant's hand (hidden behind a screen) and a rubber hand placed ahead of the participant (in a natural resting position) leads to rising of feelings that the rubber hand is actually part of the participant's body, and the tactile sensations seem to be originating in the rubber hand.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "02675c7581b1b919be4881f8ddf3855c46e8ead9_para_5": "The sensitivity to feel touch increases even after mere presentation of conflicting sensory cues -when the touch is seen, but no tactile stimulus is generated [49], thus in case coinciding with the experimental condition of this study.

In conclusion of their literature research on tactile consciousness, Gallace and Spence (2008) [18] claim that conscious perception of touch is inseparably dependent on the processing of more general (specifically, spatial) information in the brain. Tactile perception is largely dependent on the integration of information from multiple senses. This is in line with the study discovering that observing a video with a hand being touched during the reception of tactile stimuli on own hand enhances the sensory threshold [53]. Moreover, just observing touch on other human body can be 'felt'. In [28], it was found that touch observation activates the somatosensory areas in the brain. Indeed, humans posses such 'tactile empathy' that allows them to experience illusory tactile sensations while seeing other persons being touched. Interestingly, this ability can become over-active in some individuals, resulting in visually-induced tactile synaesthesia [4].", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_para_3": "Choice of laboratory-based BCI control strategies. We utilized a set of stimulus-free two-task BCI control strategies that were previously evaluated in laboratory experiments with healthy subjects.

Most importantly, they induce modulation of neural activity in broad areas of the cortex, which could make them particularly suitable for use with consumer-grade EEG equipment with few sensors. We could show that both BCI control strategies could be used in a laboratory study to induce significant differences in neural activity [3], [11], [30], [4].

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_para_1": "Virtual reality (VR) has been studied as an effective medium to provide vocational support for autistic people, for instance through training in social communication skills for job interviews [89] or job tasks (e.g., money management) [14].

Misunderstanding and conflicts can happen because of a lack of understanding about autism [22,54] and autistic people's different ways of thinking and perceiving situations are often invisible [73]. Therefore, we suggest VR designs that allow neurotypical employees to experience invisible differences of autistic employees. Past research has shown that perspective-taking, the act of perceiving situations from the other's perspective, is effective at eliciting empathy, personal distress, and in turn, maximizing motivation to help [38,80]. Therefore, we suggest an immersive and interactive VR simulation that can help neurotypical employees experience their autistic co-workers' various challenges. Using such VR, neurotypical employees could imagine how neurodiverse coworkers would feel in the simulated situation. The various sensing effects, such as distorting the VR screen to simulate dizziness or visualizing fast heartbeats on a VR screen may further help neurotypical employees experience how autistic people might feel differently in specific situations. When designing and implementing VR, researchers should investigate ways of co-designing it with autistic employees to reflect how they actually feel in specific social situations, and how VR can best reflect their thoughts and feelings.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_9": "To understand the differences between our three experimental conditions (i.e., gestures produced by people with visual impairments, gestures produced by people without visual impairments, and synthesized gestures for people with visual impairments), we ran a one-way ANOVA test (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected to control for deviations in sphericity), followed by pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) as post-hoc tests of significance, if applicable.

On the other hand, we found a high variation of daily accuracies within subjects. The consumer-grade EEG and our fitting algorithm allowed subjects to record neural data quickly, but the hardware may also pose new challenges for the BCI user: Even when perfectly fitted, the dry sensors at distant ends of the scalp may require users to induce strong, consistent modulations in neural activity in order to be reliably detected. As one potential mediator, meditation experience may affect the ability to maintain focus in unsupervised environments [27]. However, in a post-hoc analysis, we found that self-reported meditation experience is unrelated to accuracies in this study. On the other hand, daily motivational scores correlate positively with accuracy in this study. Therefore, using the MYND platform to combine easily accessible control strategies with motivating, daily feedback could further improve performance and help with more consistent execution. This feedback will need to be robust to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and higher susceptibility to involuntary head-muscle artifacts around the ears and the forehead, where the sensors are located. As one promising approach to implement robust feedback, concurrent work in [28] explored an adaptive signal-filtering method that relies on signal-variation, similar to the fitting algorithm presented here.

While all these directions are definitely interesting, they are nevertheless challenging, but worth exploring in order to advance our theoretical and practical knowledge of simulating input data across different user populations toward better interface designs for users will all abilities. Looking forward, we believe that our work already forms a good demonstration of how simulation can be used to refine the gesture design process within HCI and accessibility research and we are eager to see how the community will pick up these ideas and use them for other application areas.

It was found that thinking about positive memories increases activity in the alpha-band, while mental calculations decrease activity. Similarly, the \"Music imagery\" strategy instructs subjects to switch between playing their favorite song in their head or consecutively subtract a small number from a larger number, which has also been found to modulate parietal alpha-activity [33], [4]. Self-referential thoughts have shown to modulate activity in the theta-(3-7 Hz) alpha-(8-13 Hz) and beta-bands (17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30) of the human EEG [34], [35].

While this paper does not test academic theories of collective action or social movements, it does gesture toward ways that its qualitative and quantitative findings can relate to these theories. A substantial quantitative research tradition has asked what factors come together for a collective action such as a decision or political action to occur or be successful [60,16]. When explaining a protest or strike, political opportunity theories would focus on the nature of the grievances of movement actors, expecting that those with greater grievances would be more likely to take action [55]. Political opportunity theories would also emphasize network relations among movement actors as important factors in joining a social movement [52]. Resource mobilization theories would focus on group resources as important factors in social movement mobilization, as well as the relative isolation of a group from other participating social movement groups [53].", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_3": "Although many subreddit participants supported the blackout, the demands made in the blackout were focused entirely on the distinct interests of subreddit moderators, leaders of the site's communities. For this reason, research on the development of distinct interests among online community leaders offers a backdrop for the inductive work of this paper. In studies on a class-action lawsuit by AOL community leaders, Postigo emphasizes poor company relations with community leaders, restrictivelydesigned moderation software, and coordination among community leaders as three important factors that led volunteers to see themselves as cheated employees rather than freely-contributing volunteers [62,63]. In a study of 683 wikis drawing from scholarship on union organizations [56,47], Shaw and Hill test internal characteristics of peer communities that predict the what they term \"goal transformation\"-the development of interests distinct to a community's leaders. They find goal transformation more likely among older, more complex groups [69].", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_6": "Insofar as these findings correspond to grievance-based theories of social movement mobilization, they are consistent with expectations that groups with greater grievances are more likely to mobilize [55]. Relations between moderators were also important social factors in the blackout, as expected by political opportunity theories [52]. Yet the nature of grievances among digital volunteerism and online labor are still questions of substantial scholarly discussion [67], at a time when the nature of platforms policies towards users are also still being theorized [27].", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_21": "As we pointed out in Section 2.3, our investigation concentrated on reaction mechanisms rather than affordances. Future research should further investigate the relationship between communityspecific uses of reaction mechanisms (i.e., as affordances) and political rhetoric among social media users. Users do not evaluate reaction mechanisms simply by their technical functionality. In Reddit, voting is inseparable from the culture of the platform, with users disregarding platform rules by making, and enforcing, their own rules and norms as voting is used for pointing out who and what is \"right\", to assign and recognize social status, and to negotiate meaning and ethical norms [53]. While reaction mechanisms create the propensity to behave in specific ways, what kind of behaviors will dominate interactions depends on complex social dynamics in online communities that are difficult to control for. It is no coincidence therefore that the same reaction mechanisms can have varying effects in different digital environments and also can lead to different dimensions of user behavior (e.g., the content of posts, the frequency of posting, how long users will remain in a community, etc.) [31,71]. This social dimension of reaction mechanisms can already be recognized when evaluating the reasons why moderators on specific subreddits decide to change reaction mechanisms. For example, in our own analysis, we found that the exmuslim subreddit deactivated downvotes because of button abuse and because its usage did not end up conforming to the general rules of reddit, while other subreddits did not have a downvote in order to create a \"safe space\" for its members. These discrepancies reveal the relationship between social dimensions of the platforms and their technical design, which cannot be neglected when integrating or evaluating design features on platforms.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_title": "Gospels of Modernity: Digital Cattle Markets, Urban Religiosity, and Secular Computing in the Global South", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_para_0": "The many volunteers who lead online communities exercise tremendous power and influence as they create, maintain, and govern social relations online.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

Since we analyzed how people discuss within each community, we controlled for further factors that could have influenced interactions [6,97]. We create six different variables that represent different moderation rules that could be associated with how user discourse takes place [87]: Anonymity, which describes whether a user's real identity should remain hidden in a subreddit. No troll, which encompasses guidelines that explicitly prohibit trolling/spamming behavior that in themselves contain the usage of inflammatory language or repeated posting of nonconstructive information that can make discourse less deliberative. No hate-speech, which forbids the usage of offensive and hateful speech towards individuals and social groups, which generally leads to emotional and ungrounded rhetoric. Civility, which encompasses direct prompts in the guidelines to use civil language, and deliberation, which includes moderation rules that promote evidence-based arguments and multi-perspective discussions. We also create a variable in-group for subreddits that do focus only on the perspective of one social group (e.g., r/vegan, r/enoughtrumpspam) and explicitly mention in their guidelines that other opinions about an issue will not be tolerated, potentially leading to higher \"we vs. them\" rhetoric and less counterargument structures. These variables serve as proxies of either the implementation of rules that explicitly aimed to alter the nature of discourse [17,41,104] or that have been implemented because of abrupt incidents and patterns in user dynamics that moderators wanted to control [72,111,116].

Prior work shows that lack of airtime subsidy leads to low call volume and engagement [51,62], which causes IVR services to struggle with long-term sustainability [63]. Successful IVR forums have also engaged and retained users through social features (e.g. voting and comments) [49,62], spreading mechanisms such as the ability to forward content to friends [49,50], incentivized referrals [61], and advertisements [41]. Contrary to these prevailing norms, we designed and deployed Karamad without subsidies, social features, spreading mechanisms, or advertisements.

Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users\u2019 style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being \u201cideal constructs of political rhetoric,\u201d we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship between social media interface design and respectful political discussion among users.1", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_13": "This paper makes two main contributions.

For instance, prior work has seen self-focus bias with respect to geography (i.e., people contribute information about places local to them) [28,42,47,100]. Self-focus bias is also prevalent in peer-produced content in terms of language [46,48,89] and politics [52].", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_2": "A key motivating factor in the literature on gender dynamics in peer production is concern that gender participation disparities will result in corresponding gender content disparities. In other words, it has been assumed that the limited representation of women may lead to peer-produced content that is less able to serve women's information needs [51,65,92] and that the many AI systems that \"learn\" from peer-produced content may take on a biased view of the world [49,56].

Most existing studies in this area use quantitative methods that do not take interactional context into account [11], and it has been recently suggested that smartphone use should be analyzed in the context of participants' daily environments [24,52,87]. While prior HCI studies have elucidated many important aspects of collaborative smartphone use [8-10, 74, 75], self-initiated individual smartphone use has received much less attention. This study contributes to the body of HCI literature by uncovering and describing common patterns of individual smartphone use in everyday co-present interactions. Our fndings demonstrate when and how young adults themselves initiate, carry out, and terminate individual smartphone use when interacting with others. Below, we summarize the key fndings, situate them within previous research and present implications for HCI. We discuss the role of context in the way smartphone use is initiated, factors afecting whether smartphone use is carried out as a temporarily prioritized or as a parallel activity, reasons for reciprocating one's smartphone use and participants' strategies for managing extended smartphone use. The analysis of naturally occurring interactions also allows us to respecify phubbing and suggest guidelines for further research. Drawing on participants' practices of managing extended smartphone use, we propose how the design of mobile technologies can better facilitate social interactions.

Das et al. (2017a) proposed a visual dialog task in which a conversational agent attempts to answer questions regarding an assigned image based on a dialog history. To approach this task, they initially collected data by having two people chat about an image with one person acting as the questioner and the other as the answerer. GuessWhich (Chattopadhyay et al., 2017) extends VisDial with the goal to build an agent that learns how to identify a target image through question and answers. (de Vries et al., 2016) additionally introduced a game in which a series of yes-or-no questions are asked by an agent in order to locate an object in an image. Many researchers approached these tasks via reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of obtaining an optimal dialog policy. Zhang et al. (2017), for example, designed three rewards with respect to the goals of task achievement, efficiency, and question informativeness, in order to help the agent to achieve an effective question generation policy for GuessWhat game. Das et al. (2017b) applies reinforcement learning in the GuessWhich task and demonstrates a moderate improvement in accuracy compared to the supervised learning approach. Both methods apply RL on a neural end-to-end pipeline to jointly influence the language generation and dialog policy. Due the challenge of designing an appropriate reward for language generation, these methods generate responses that deviate from human natural language. Zhang et al. (2018), proposed an approach involving hierarchical reinforcement learning and state-adaptation techniques that enable the agent to learn an optimal and efficient multi-modal policy. The bottleneck of (Zhang et al., 2018)'s method, however, is that the system response is retrieved from a predefined humanwritten or system-generated utterance. The number of predefined responses are limited, therefore, this method does not easily generalize to other tasks in real-world settings. We address these limitations by applying RL on a reduced, yet more relevant action space, while optimizing the dialog generator in a supervised fashion. We alternatively optimize policy learning to language generation to combine the two tasks together.", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_para_1": "Dialogue generation is an important research topic in NLP, thus many approaches have been proposed to address this task. Most earlier works made use of a predefined template (Lemon et al., 2006;Wang and Lemon, 2013) to generate dialogues. More recently, deep neural networks have been used for building end-to-end architectures capable of generating questions (Vinyals and Le, 2015;Sordoni et al., 2015) and also for the task of goal-oriented dialogue generation (Rajendran et al., 2018;Bordes et al., 2017). Visual dialogue focuses on having a conversation about an image with either one or both of the agents being a machine. Since its inception (Das et al., 2017), different approaches have been proposed to address this problem (Massiceti et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2017;Das et al., 2017). Goaloriented Visual Dialogue, on the other hand, is an area that has only been introduced fairly recently. De Vries et al.  proposed the GuessWhat?! dataset for goal-oriented visual dialogue while Strub et al.  developed a reinforcement learning approach for Figure 2: A block diagram of our model. The framework is trained on top of three individual models: the questioner (QGen), the guesser, and the oracle. The guesser returns an object distribution given a history of question-answer pairs that are generated by the questioner and the oracle respectively. These distributions are used for calculating the information gain of the question-answer pair. The information gain and distribution of probabilities given by the Guesser are used either as a reward or optimized as a loss function with global rewards for training the questioner.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_title": "Few-Shot Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Sequential Prototypical Networks", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_para_1": "Various RL-based models have been proposed to train task-oriented dialog systems (Williams and Young, 2007). In order to build a traditional modular-based dialog system, researchers first identify the semantic representation, such as the dialog acts and slots in user utterances. Then they accumulate these semantic representations over time to track the dialog state. Finally they apply RL to learn an optimized dialog policy given the dialog state (Raux et al., 2005;Shi and Yu, 2018). Such modular-based dialog systems are effective in narrow task domains, such as searching a bus route schedule and reserving a restaurant through natural language, but they fail to generalize to complex settings where the size of the action space increases. Owing to the development of deep learning, RL on neural sequence-to-sequence models has been explored in more complex dialog domains such as open-domain conversation (Li et al., 2016) and negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017). However, due to the difficulty of assigning appropriate rewards when operating in a large action space, these frameworks cannot generate fluent dialog utterances. Zhao et al. (2019) proposed a novel latent action RL framework to marry the advantage of a module based approach and sequence-to-sequence approach. They learned the optimal dialog policy in a complex task-oriented dialog domain while achieving decent conversation quality. We study the similar issue in a multimodal task-oriented dialog scenario.

This task is challenging since these questions must not only be consistent with a strategy to achieve a goal, but also consider the contextual information in the image. We propose an end-to-end goal-oriented visual dialogue system, that combines reinforcement learning with regularized information gain.

saving the energy of applications by refactoring. Zhang et al. [17] developed an automatic refactoring tool for Android applications which enables the applications to perform on-demand computation offloading at runtime to improve the performance and save energy. Lin et al. [9] developed an automatic refactoring tool which transfers incorrect An-droid async constructs into correct ones. The tool can extract long-running operations and encapsulate them in Async-Task for better performance. The application refactoring tool ASYNCDROID [8] helps Android developers to correct misused asynchronous programming constructs (AsyncTask) to IntentService, which uses a distributed communication instead of shared memory communication to prevent memory leak. Hao et al. [5] proposed a binary instrumentation framework for Android applications which can be used to specify instrumentation location compactly and precisely at different granularities. Lenin Ravindranath et al. [12] implemented an automatic fault detecting system for mobile applications by instrumenting the application binary to emulate various user, network and sensor behaviors to detect failures. Although these works also involve the analysis and transformation of Android applications, our work is targeted at a different specific goal, i.e., augmenting applications with lightweight interactive

Each designer started with a 15-minute tutorial of the Juji platform by watching a tutorial video and learning several key Juji features (e.g., how to customize a chatbot's actions). They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2.

The model assumes that users have an implicit temporal point of aim within the target window, the point in time at which they intend the input event to be registered. However, the model further assumes that their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by variability accumulating over three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. Two empirical parameters capture the changes in the point of aim and variability. The model yields a task-specific response distribution, a Gaussian in time, from which error rate E can be calculated. The mathematical description captures a transition between two response strategies found in previous studies: anticipation and reaction [7,31]. Users tend to rely more on anticipation (their internal clock) than on reaction when the task becomes more difficult.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705). Users cannot precisely control how high they hold their finger, and the variation in distance between the finger and surface may have increased variability.", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_3": "Fitts' law [8] predicts minimum movement time M T with two spatial requirements: movement distance D s and target width W s . In other words, the user is asked to move as quickly as possible to hit the target. Fitts introduced the concept of index of difficulty: M T = a + bID s = a+b log 2 (2D s /W s ). Wobbrock et al. [40] analysed Fitts' law to derive a model of error rates with three task requirements mixed in the temporal and spatial domain: target size D s , target width W s , and temporal target distance D t . As this paper does, they predicted error rates, because there was an explicit requirement to maintain a temporal distance to the target D t . Besides, when the spatial requirement W s is relaxed from Fitts' task, targeting becomes more open-loop-like. Gan and Hoffman [9] proposed a model to predict M T when the goal is to hit a large target at distance D s . Hoffman's law originally predicted M T = a + b \u221a D s . With additional assumptions, it can be expressed as the constant ratio between D s and the standard deviation (SD) of end points [12].", "2c11cb80ff697f81d2e67ee87fb4a0064ef48954_title": "Efficient Sampling of Dependency Structure", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_title": "Classification of telicity using cross-linguistic annotation projection", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "a901f5afe745a4d0c348619d2035b823b7fbd2c3_title": "The Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_para_8": "Intercepting a moving target demands considering both spatial and temporal amplitude to the target, but, depending on the target's speed and size, precision might also be required [4]. To our knowledge, there is no model of target interception that would consider the case of temporal pointing wherein the spatial task requirement is negligible. Anticipation-coincidence studies [17,3] and the Newell group's work [22,11,23,16,13] have offered a mixed view, wherein temporal and spatial requirements co-exist. Two distinct categories of existing models can be recognised: 1) models assuming preprogrammed responses and 2) on-line control models. There has been some criticism of these models [35]. One critical issue is that several strategies are possible. For example, when one is capturing a target, four distinct strategies have been identified (pursuit, head-on, receding, and perpendicular) [35]. The strategy is affected by how the target moves, its identity, whether it is to be captured or hit, and how it is approached. One replicated finding is that when moving targets require more temporal precision (smaller W t ), people increase the movement velocity [36,4,34].

This has been explained by reference to a process that maintains optimal strategy between spatial and temporal precision [32,41].

In accordance to our hypothesis, mark orientation had a signifcant efect on the accuracy of the estimations for trend orientation (F (3, 210) = 5.06, p < .05) and trend intercept (F (3, 216) = 5.86, p < .001).

Similarly, marks pointing towards the full OLS line (Tri-O) produced less error with respect to this line, while the other two marks perform similarly. Our results also support the fnding of Correll & Heer [7] that participants downweighted outlying points when making trend estimates. For the following analyses we therefore used the robust trend line as our basis of comparison. Results for estimating intercepts can be found in the supplemental materials. Outlier Distance. Corresponding to our hypothesis, outlying clusters further away from the remaining points were considered less important for trend estimation.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours.

In this paper, we propose to represent facts in the input text as a knowledge graph (KG) and present a novel task of generating a question given a query path from the KG. More specifically, a KG contains a set of fact triples, and a query path is an ordered sequence of triples in the KG. A fact triple consists of two entities and their relationship. Figure 1b shows the KG of the input text in Figure 1a and it includes two query paths. We can see that not all facts in a query path are mentioned in a specific target question (see Path 2 and GTQ2). Therefore, the model needs to extract the involved facts to form a query before it generates a question. Intuitively, we divide the task of question generation from a query path into two steps, namely, query representation learning and query-based question generation. We formulate the former step as a sequence labeling problem for identifying the involved facts to form a query. For query-based question generation, an RNN-based generator is used to generate the question word by word. We first train the two modules jointly in an end-to-end fashion (PathQG in Section 3). In order to further enforce the interaction between theses two modules, we employ a variational framework to train the two modules (Chen et al., 2018; that treats query representation learning as an inference process from the query path taking the generated question as the target (PathQG-V in Section 4).", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_2": "We build upon the work of Clark et al.

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model.

For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Benefiting from designing various effective self-supervised learning objectives, such as masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2018), PLMs can effectively capture the syntax and semantics in text to generate informative language representations for downstream NLP tasks. However, conventional pre-training objectives do not explicitly model relational facts, which frequently distribute in text and are crucial for understanding the whole text. To address this issue, some recent studies attempt to improve PLMs to better understand relations between entities (Soares et al., Peng et al., 2020).

However, there is a significant semantic and structural gap between natural language and action sequences, which makes this conversion difficult. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-enhanced complex question answering framework, called ALCQA, which mitigates this gap through question-to-action alignment and question-to-question alignment. We train a question rewriting model to align the question and each action, and utilize a pretrained language model to implicitly align the question and KG artifacts. Moreover, considering that similar questions correspond to similar action sequences, we retrieve top-k similar question-answer pairs at the inference stage through question-to-question alignment and propose a novel reward-guided action sequence selection strategy to select from candidate action sequences.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015). Recently, neural architectures have been shown effective in such a task, whereby minimal feature engineering is required (Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Peters et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Domain adaptation, as a special case for transfer learning, aims to exploit the abundant data of wellstudied source domains to improve the performance in target domains of interest (Pan and Yang, 2010;Weiss et al., 2016). There is a growing interest in investigating the transferability of neural models for NLP. Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b). The INIT method first trains a model using labeled data from the source domain; next, it initializes a target model with the learned parameters; finally, it fine-tunes the initialized target model using labeled data from the target domain.

To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image.

Conflicts are especially common in the peer review process, in which people decide whether one's contributions should be accepted or not [42]. There are different forms of peer review in different online collaboration settings. In many software development projects, there is a formal peer review system where contributors propose code changes (e.g., pull-requests in GitHub) and reviewers decide whether the contribution should be accepted or not [40]. In Wikipedia, both formal peer review and informal peer review exists. For instance, featured articles (FA) are determined by a formal peer review process where group of editors decide whether candidate articles should be promoted to FA or not [1]. Additionally, any edit on Wikipedia articles could be viewed as being informally \"peer reviewed\" [37]. On most unprotected pages, any editors can \"review\" others' edits.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

While many studies focus on the bottom-level local context of program implementation [6,31,120] and note the importance of understanding political analysis [123], there has been sparse reporting on the highlevel context in which policy and programs are formed. Heeks emphasized that the high rate of ICTD program failure arises from the \"design-reality gaps\" that arise from a lack of understanding of decision-makers' and program designers' contexts [53]. Overall, sufficient insights have not yet been articulated on the high-level political contexts and actors, such as the political visions and priorities influencing and driving ICTD programs and how projects and policies change as they go through a central authority (from the government to national and international organizations, including donors) [124]. We intend to contribute to this discussion by presenting the nature and roots of these gaps in the public health nutrition context in Bangladesh.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_abstract": "Historically, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) researchers in the Global South have advocated for a community-based approach to technology design and development. However, even with this \"bottom-up\" emphasis, the sustainability and scalability of the resulting innovations remain major challenges, and are poorly understood. To address this gap, we take the case of Bangladesh as a typical Global South context in which development work is carried out by a complex intertwined network of stakeholders across governments, NGOs, donors, and industries. To better understand the current development landscape and its priorities for digital technologies, we conducted interviews with 14 influential decision-makers in Bangladesh who play significant roles in the development of nutrition strategies. Our findings highlight a disconnect between the Bangladesh government's \"digital mandate\" and the reality of digital innovation practice within the nutrition development sector. Our paper contributes to the debate on factors that affect decision-making processes. We explore the dynamics of diverse actors and institutions who are intended to participate in, but can act as obstacles to sustained bottom-up innovations. Our findings expand understanding of institutional priorities, the dynamics of intermediaries, techno-solutionism, postcolonialism, bureaucracy, competition, and other important topics in CSCW scholarship. We suggest understanding the factors that guide the decision-making process of digital innovation practices in terms of four dimensions: internal, external, vertical, and horizontal. Consequently, we recommend CSCW and HCI researchers become mediators to connect decision-makers and communities and bring their voices in ICT innovations for global development. Finally, we offer recommendations for proactive engagement with decision-making stakeholders, enabling researchers to design community-centered sustainable digital innovations for development.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_10": "Our findings show how the priorities of higher-level stakeholders, such as governments, UN groups, and donor agencies, shape ICT innovations in nutrition development programs in Bangladesh and that the opportunities for bottom-up approaches to innovation in public health nutrition in Bangladesh are still limited. The tendency of governments and donors to push technology innovations into Global South contexts is not a new phenomenon, as discussed in literature that we highlighted in our related work section. However, distinctions between the ways in which top-down authority is invoked is necessary to clarify that the actions of high-level policymakers, government officeholders, and multinational NGOs are not necessarily antithetical to the success of development innovations. Those involved in CSCW and HCI4D have long advocated for engaging with under-represented groups and bringing under-explored topics to the fore. We extend this line of work by arguing for incorporating marginalized communities' voices as part of an engagement with program and policy makers into the decision-making process. Our findings highlight that this incorporation is often challenged by various internal and external factors in the local governing system. By considering the interactions among diverse top-down institutions [58,76,114,115] their institutioning, the intermediaries involved (such as multi-sectoral actors in government INGOs and donor agencies), and the dynamics of intermediation, we can articulate how they work and where HCI can contribute in the processes of digital innovations with and for marginalized communities. Hence, we suggest that HCI researchers develop a nuanced understanding of the policy and program-making contexts within which their intervention is placed. We suggest there is a potentially fruitful opportunity for HCI researchers to take a middle-man approach and connect the bottom-up and top-down contexts [37].", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_2": "Understanding local contexts, including appropriate technology design and selection and social, cultural, economic, and political factors, is highlighted by many researchers on the developing world as important in addressing sustainable ICTD [8,51,53,120,123]. James C. Scott [105] showed, in relation to his large program failure cases, that successful program design needs to value local and practical knowledge for implementation. Anokwa et al. [6] also emphasized the understanding of challenges and the importance of collaboration at the local levels. Conversely, the unintentional practice of ICTD researchers conducting short-term visits to complete their research to make publications and recommendations without any meaningful impact is also highlighted as an ethical concern and a reason behind the lack of sustainable impact of ICTD in Global South contexts [32,33]. In response, Dearden and Tucker [33] suggested that \"actors in the broader field of ICTD implementation (i.e., action by NGOs, aid agencies, and other organizations innovating and applying technology to development challenges) should examine how resources are used and how decisions are taken so that systemic and sustainable capacity building is prioritized. \"", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_0": "Over the last two decades in Global South contexts, researchers carrying out Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) have argued for the input of local communities, advocating for technology innovation that is culturally appropriate and non-technocratic.

However, the inability to sustain a more extended period to scale up technology-based programs and projects remain as absolute constraints in Global South countries [31,51,54,120,123,125]. It has also been recognized that for digital innovation to be successful and sustainable, the wider stakeholder landscape needs to be considered alongside local practices and participatory design processes [21]. The importance of understanding the collaborative nature of solution research, design, and use and collaboration with decision-making stakeholders has been emphasized by several researchers in CSCW and HCI [37,61,66,72,73,109]. Kumar and Dell [69] go further and have demonstrated the need for a deeper understanding of how global development practitioners use innovation to generate informed practice for successful HCI4D. However, it has remained under-studied why and how the bureaucratically led policymaking process, which often involves embarking on unfounded, overestimated, and expensive technology deployments, is mismatched with the demonstrable value gained from engaging communities on the ground. Further, there is little well-articulated literature on the high-level political contexts and actors in Global South countries, such as the political visions and priorities influencing and driving Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) programs and how projects and policies change as they go through central authorities (from the government to national and international organizations) [124].", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_title": "Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_4": "CSCW and HCI for program and policy research have a historical perspective informed by the work of social informatics researchers such as Kling, King, and Scacchi in the early '80s [65][66][67].

Jackson et al. [62] recognized that there is a disconnection among research, design, and practice in the field of CSCW and argued for a holistic orientation, proposing an interconnected \"knot model\" (among design, use, and collaboration with organizations within public policy systems) with a focus on policy, practice, and design. The role of policy design was also investigated by Jackson and colleagues, [63] who emphasized the need for collaboration and mutual learning between scientific study and policy to successfully navigate design, infrastructure, and organizational collaboration complexities. They highlighted that traditional CSCW is more focused on \"implication for design\" than \"implication for policy\" in regard to ambitions of long-term social impact. Similarly, Freeman et al.

This paper further depicts how such secularization contributes to diminishing rural-urban linkages, affecting electoral politics, and reducing the tolerance to religious celebrations in a city. Drawing from a rich body of work in critical urban studies, postcolonial computing, and sociology of religions, we explain how such oft-overlooked embedding of secularization in computing affects the religious fabrics in the urban regions of the Global South, and discuss its implication for HCI scholarship in diversity, inclusion, and development.", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_4": "The studies mentioned above inform HCI of the need for exploring religious values, socio-cultural-religious norms, active participation of religious groups with technologies, and their evolved religious practices and lifestyles.

The review on HCI4D by Dell and Kumar noted that, \"nearly half of the papers (128) target 'ground-level users' to respond to their specific needs and challenges\" [35]. With this, we see a significant amount of HCI4D work has been conducted in the areas of sharing agricultural communication and information with farmers [43,94], health [68,92] and nutrition for women [23,110], facilitating field tasks with health workers [100], educational technology [121], monitoring and evaluation (M&E) purposes for NGOs [11,74], and safety and security goals for women [3,5]. Furthermore, researchers have also shown that there is a big push in the Global South to transfer technologies from the West and use them in international development contexts, copying the western practice of innovation [59], which is compounded by the UN and other NGOs advocating for the innovation and use of digital technology towards achieving all SDGs [89]. While there is a definite upward trend of using ICT in most development programs and projects, an inability to sustain such innovation for an extended period after the initial research is conducted, so as to be able to scale up technology-based programs and projects, remains an absolute constraint [8,31,51,54,123,124].

This intention create additional new technologies is a threat where questions of sustainability and scalability of those technologies are substantive, leading to many instances of technological innovations that fall under the heading of \"solutionism. \" This tendency is often cited in social and political science critiques as \"technology solutionism\" or the \"technology fix. \" In recent HCI design research, fixing problems that don't exist and proposing\"quick fixes\" or \"silver bullets\" for complicated social, political, and environmental challenges are criticized as \"solutionist\" [18,19,75,86]. The \"technosolutionism\" ideology was critiqued by Morozov [85], who pointed out the political tendency to believe blindly in the ability of technology to solve challenges with innovative design. On democratizing the potential of the internet and ICT, Morozov also highlighted a critical point of debate on political transformation in digital societies, expressing skepticism toward governments' ability to promote democracy through the internet in the West, adding that \"techno-solutionism\" ignores debates about politics, history, culture, actual needs and challenges, and people's capacities to adopt new technologies [85].", "00ee24a7fc7b1ee8cc3050d388ce775045c16ef1_title": "Participatory Design Goes to School: Co-Teaching as a Form of Co-Design for Educational Technology", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_11": "First, we need to consider external factors and actors. More specifically, CSCW and HCI4D designers and researchers need to know who the prominent multi-sectoral decision-making institutes and actors are (such as governments, NGOs, UN groups, and donors) in a targeted international development sector (such as public health nutrition). We need to be aware of and consider all external influences and motivations where these decision-makers work as \"innovation intermediaries\" [111] to shape and implement innovations. For instance, within these diverse top-down institutions, CSCW and HCI researchers need to consider external factors of institutioning [76], such as how the global and national mandates, agendas, evidence-based approaches, and priorities constantly move and shape innovations. Second, we need to consider internal factors to understand the dynamics of these intermediaries [58,114,115] by understanding their political motivations, existing competitions, perceptions, and expectations of using ICTs in development programs and policies. Third, we need to understand vertical mechanisms and interactions. For instance, we need to consider mechanisms such as the way top-down approaches and actors such as decision-makers inform the bottom-up actors such as marginalized citizens and vice-versa [38]. Finally, we need to consider horizontal mechanisms and interactions by considering existing practices and processes within innovation. These include understanding how these diverse decision-making actors work and collaborate with each other and the dynamics of their diverse collaborations and intermediaries. Consideration of both internal and external factors are also needed within both vertical and horizontal mechanisms of interaction.

Institutioning refers to working within diverse institutions [36], and is a useful frame for understanding the complexity within community-based design processes, particularly when conducting a program with a participatory design (PD) [114,115]. These scenarios are characterized as situations in which the process is constantly moving horizontally and vertically between and within diverse micro-meso and macro levels [58] and call for attention to the significant relationships between policy, institutions, and meta-cultural frames [58,115]. PD approaches in social computing are figured by a diverse group of institutions, and need to be understood in terms of the meso-and macro-level institutions that PD is dependent on and informed by [58]. Dearden and colleagues [33] also acknowledged the need to understand the institutioning involved in critical computing issues. In the debate on HCI and social innovation, they also contribute to the insufficiently studied issue of HCI designers' lack of attention past the research context to how innovations become distributed and adopted for social goods. Political issues surrounding technology, such as how decisions are made for technology adoption and scale-up in programs may be understood through the complexities of institutioning and the actors at the decision-making level [114,115], where these institutions and their individuals are broadly influenced by their own objectives and priorities, yet have to translate initiatives between designers and communities [25,26].", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_title": "'It's Problematic but I'm not Concerned': University Perspectives on Account Sharing", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "05681b9803be6bf62dcca9c864cca206743e4759_title": "Gamification in Science: A Study of Requirements in the Context of Reproducible Research", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_title": "The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias", "dbb419268a467a0f42f737ab4386bf42ca6ecd65_title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_para_11": "Critical awareness of the socio-political environment. The research presented here exposed the infrastructural challenges of the school, spanning stafng, equipment and the built environment, impacting the quality of provision for students. Here, design of technology needs to be done against the backdrop of this socio-cultural environment, a perspective that is widely acknowledged in HCI research [70]. Nevertheless, our work leaves us wondering whether the methods and approaches frequently used in HCI research, e.g., interviews, co-design workshops that are embedded in institutions as special, and often researcher-led events, or observations that may be limited to a small number of days, can achieve critical awareness. Instead, we hypothesize that short-term engagement at institutions that is so common in our research community may result in recording only front-stage behaviors [27], leading to fundamentally fawed assumptions about the role and potential of technology [22,53]. Moreover, there has been a call for applying infrastructuring, i.e., designing for the integration of new tools and technologies with existing people, materials and tools [46]. This approach emphasizes the need for temporal scaling [46] in an efort of \"sustaining and maintaining the results of HCI research and design projects, including technological artefacts, beyond the runtime of such projects and beyond the role that researchers played within the project context. \" [49] Researchers have also called for \"broken world thinking\" [45], focusing from the start of the design on how to support maintenance and repair [44]. In this vision, DIY approaches are considered particularly useful as they allow users without a technological background to leapfrog [68] and take on the maintenance and repair. However, other authors challenge the extent to which such processes of breakdown and repair can be anticipated [69], and point out that such an uncritical focus on independence of makers/repairers ignores the importance of a supportive maker community that, on an enduring basis, invests time in spreading understanding and support of how to reassemble physical and digital materials [81]. In other words, breakdown and repair is governed by the sociopolitical as well; by situational access to repair parts and availability of expertise, which in the context of this observed school for disabled children was problematic. Hence, our observations demonstrate how systematic underfunding can undercut such an aspiration. In a context where teachers and therapists are already overburdened, let alone given the time and space to tinker, and where basic ICT infrastructure to manage the dependencies is not guaranteed due to understafed ICT support and subsequent inadequate technological choices, DIY approaches are likely to complicate ongoing processes of empowerment, taking up precious time and resources.  [13,35,56,57]; the open availability and inherent adaptability of maker technologies serve the requirement for customization, while its hacker spirit results in afordable maintenance. Hence, upon a frst analysis through the perspective of Zimmerman, maker technology provides control over and access to important resources, highlighting its potential to contribute to empowerment. Yet, despite its promising ideology, the adoption of making technologies in the creation of successful assistive technology still has barriers [37,56,76], and non-use and abandonment of assistive technologies persist [39,50,59]. This paradox was at the heart of this paper, exploring the potential of DIY approaches in a school for disabled children.", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_16": "Sustainable impact requires interventions to \"recognize and leverage resources already existing in the community, including physical and social infrastructure, skills, knowledge, networks, and environmental resources\" [95]. Partly driven by a political mandate to engage youth explicitly as part of their digital innovation strategy, our participants argued for leveraging youth potential, seeing them as agents of change. This a priori interest in youth engagement signifies how decisionmakers think of population segments, which will be key in successful innovation diffusion. Notably, this is not limited only to creating youth-friendly applications or creating \"lite\" youth versions of apps aimed at adults. Youth are traditionally construed as \"human becomings,\" \"denigrating their present lives, while focusing only on the adults they will become\" [7]. For decision-makers, the youth of today have an essential role to play in Bangladesh's digital innovation narrative in the present. This is also a strategic decision when it is considered that 40% of the country's population is under the age of 18, a phenomenon that is not exclusive to Bangladesh [104]. The UK's leading development institute, ODI, argues that since the world now has the largest generation aged 15-24 in history (and 90% of these youth live in Global South countries), a unique opportunity is afforded to development practitioners and theorists. There is \"a one-time window of opportunity for a concerted international effort to help developing countries reap a 'demographic dividend' from educated, healthy and gainfully employed young women and men, and achieve far higher economic growth rates\" [96]. However, we also urge caution here and advise that any attempts to mediate youth engagement with decision-makers needs to be carried out with the utmost care. Though ostensibly motivated by youth empowerment, authorities as well as non-state actors have repeatedly sought to disrupt spaces for youth participation or co-opt them towards their own political agendas. Moreover, if development projects consider youth perspectives and motivations for development, they can be included in initiatives whose primary target populations are adults. For instance, when targeting information dissemination to women farmers, we should consider young people's role as change-makers in farming communities. Hence, we recommend that every national and regional development context has population segments that are prioritized for innovation roll-out due to factors such as high early adoption rates or alignment with national agendas. When configuring projects, we recommend that HCI researchers consider how their projects will leverage these population segments to maximize their impact.", "9f240a56b8e13e9da50966eb5cfcb4c8aa91e631_para_12": "Taking a closer look at some examples of technology innovations that have been able to create sustainable impact, we see that in addition to a commitment to work within local constraints and infrastructures, practitioners emphasize the value of collaborations with multiple NGO stakeholders and/or government agencies in contributing to their impact. As an example, Ushahidi (a platform for local communities to share their stories) [82,102] was successful due to strong collaborations with local NGOs, which not only added a layer of trust to NGO-verified contributions but also increased uptake [119]. Similarly, the 'Our Story' (currently known as 'Indaba') participatory video platform was pioneered by HCI researchers by leveraging the institutional networks of the Red Cross Movement's umbrella body IFRC (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, who operate on both top-down and bottom-up dimensions [126]). Through this collaboration, a number of relationships with NGOs at the local level were brokered (with the Indonesian Red Cross and Namibian Red Cross, for example) [11] which were used by the IFRC to advocate for sustained use of the tool within the wider network. Finally, RootIO (a platform for low-cost community radio) similarly credits their success to extensive collaborations with content partners, politicians, community leaders, networks of youth centers, and contacts within government ministries [26,29]. Indeed, RootIO collaborated with national communications regulators and involved local community NGOs [28] in each deployment. We recommend that as part of the requirement of initial informationgathering within social computing and HCI for development project collaborations, researchers should find out the priorities of local political stakeholders who play influential roles in regional development and areas of alignment or difference between collaborators and other NGOs and government ministries who work in that sector.", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "0ce53aa7ed03fae1db4fc742e81e45a260ceee77_para_1": "At least half of the manifestos express concerns about sustainability in IoT returning us to the question of progress both in the manifestos and in HCI. Environmental sustainability is a major concern for HCI tied to technological interventions [10]. Within sustainable HCI technology design and development is implicated in an impulse to create change [16]. Much of this research has turned problems of environmental action into questions of personal moral choice, often focusing on behavior change as a route to altering individual consumption patterns [10]. An alternative path has focused on 'ecologies of practices' within design and HCI [8,27]. In the manifestos the latter approach to sustainability is more apparent. Just a few documents imagine how IoT could be used to change, augment or improve individual behavior (Kr\u00fcger, RIOT; Smit, RIOT). We identify three main notions of sustainability in the manifestos: realigning lifetimes of the physical and the digital, obsolescence and locality.

The first emphasises the issues that arise from implementations which are disconnected from the social, cultural, and physical attributes that are unique to the African context. The second suggests HCI methods that incorporate indigenous concepts in order to make research outputs relevant to end users [57]. In this regard, HCI has been examined through the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu and its philosophical underpinnings have been used as a structural basis which grants situated orientation [58] and provides a relevant framework for design innovation, technology use, its adoption, and how it can drive business innovation in Africa. In recent years, HCI has gained traction in Africa with a strong emphasis on opportunities availed by mobile technologies and increased access to internet and affordability of devices. This has led to great emphasis on design and deployment of usercentered digital solutions that are enmeshed with the needs of an African audience to solve African problems. Building on this work, this paper thus situates itself not in a development discourse -where the researcher designs from an assumption that the non-western community is in need of development and would unquestionably benefit from western technologies [8] -but instead from an afro-centric discourse where knowledge and innovation from the continent is legitimate and equal to others, and can spark innovation and problem-solving in similar contexts on and off the continent.", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_title": "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Using Code-Mixed TreeBank", "c7ff66f3654a351b66a8d94919f9cc5a2f6c121c_para_3": "straightforward marketplace applications, and the popularity of social media platforms have made selling and buying products and services online a widely prevalent practice in the urban regions of the country [70,120,140].

Thousands of products and services are being published, promoted, and purchased over various online platforms ranging from government-developed websites to personal Facebook pages of the sellers [20,66,100]. One of the newest additions of this trend is the digitization of the 'physical' cattle markets (traditionally held in the urban areas during Eid), which has received signifcant attention in Bangladesh recently. Such transformations often engender many socio-cultural tensions and put the efort of digitizing the countries in the Global South into question. While a rich body of literature in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD), and related felds has focused on diferent aspects of digital marketplaces [36,50,59,101], very few studies have been conducted in the context of the Global South [42,104,131].

We suggest that this problem also be brought to the table when doing such as designing a nutrition program with the local community. A grassroots-level movement, for example, may create a nationwide awareness against such unjustified pressure to deploy digital technologies. We are excited about the potential of various HCI interventions that have allowed local people to voice such concerns in the Global South [11,81,84,121,122], and we believe that such technologies might be useful in addressing the problems at the top to help make a bottom-up design successful.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_10": "In this section, we reflect on the results of our work, its limitations, and the research opportunities in crowdsourcing.

However, our study did not include a gendered lens to analyze urban public space and how digital cattle markets could help women avoid gender-based spatial discrimination. Furthermore, the fndings of our study are limited within the participants that we chose through our social network and convenience. Hence, we refrain from any generalization of our fndings beyond the studied setting. We rather focus on the strength of such ethnographic studies in the richness of the details and depth of data.

Huybrechts et al.

Our data show how our participants were experiencing a reduction of religious visibility, sensitivity, and performativity in diferent socioeconomic contexts of their urban lives in both the physical and online worlds. One of the popular strands of critical urban theory explains such reduction of religiosity as modernism's limitation to comprehend the complex entanglements of religion in the lives of urban dwellers. Our fndings are aligned with this line of critical work by various scholars (inter alia, AbdouMaliq Simone [123], Ara Wilson [133], Hancock [58], and Parthasarathy [108]), who critically address how scientifc tools and techniques reinforce a 'simplifed' version of urban life that is stripped of its complex religious and political relationships, and suppress the growth of alternative religion-backed modernities in urban contexts, especially in the Global South. While urban scholars are bringing religion to the disciplinary conversations to subjugate modernism's limitations, HCI is still struggling to go beyond implementing the scientifc rationalities and modernist assumptions to address the contextual needs of diferent religious groups [128]. An emerging group of scholars have started shedding light on these limitations of HCI, and providing important design implications to overcome them [73,103,113,128].Our study joins this scholarship, and argues that the existing praxis of urban HCI, urban computing, and related felds seldom address the needs of diferent religious groups, and religiosity hardly gets mediated through urban spatial, political, and socio-cultural design within HCI. We believe that this is essential to include religiosity-backed urban spatial politics in HCI conversations, which will create novel avenues of research and design for HCI and ICTD scholarship. Several HCI design paradigms including Value Sensitive Design (VSD) and Participatory Design (PD) might be useful to make designs more inclusive of religious values and practices. The contribution of this paper is not exactly about the 'process' of design, but about understanding the nature of modernity that is being extended through the use of digital tools and techniques. Thus, this paper connects HCI literature on urban HCI to a rich thread of work in social science and STS around the criticism of scientifc modernity [88], epistemic pluralism in design [51], and the appropriation of material infrastructure in urban areas [43].", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_8": "Crowdsourcing has been a highly productive area for HCI research for over a decade.

Larry Cuba pointed out that this tendency has a political aspect that goes beyond social factors and triggers political motivations [30]. These concepts bear resemblance to the concept of the \"sociotechnical imaginary\" that is broadly used in the field of social technology. Sociotechnical imaginaries are generally futureoriented visions of connected social and technological orders operated by key individuals and institutions [64]. Although scholars have noted that sociotechnical imaginaries can identify paths and actions for effective innovations, they caution that disparate imaginaries can bring very different programs and policies to society [64,108]. Our study also contributes to this growing area of literature on the relationship between decision-makers' power and techno-scientific innovations. As social computing and HCI4D researchers, we want to raise the possibility of positions and initiatives that address this techno-focused solutionism among decision-makers so as to resolve the contradictory vision between innovation and sustainability. Indeed, such tech obsession has already been reported in the CSCW and HCI4D literature (for example, see [83]), and various critical and speculative design interventions and ethnographic studies have been done in the HCI literature to counter such utopian thinking [10,36,97,106]. However, little has been done to operationalize this criticism in practice that can significantly impact policymaking. Moreover, a deliberate effort towards affordable (in both financial and human resource) technology design is required, using existing platforms to capture community voices in ways such as using participatory media to invite marginalized voices and to share with decision-makers to inform programs and policies. Such efforts should consider designing systems according to both high-level and bottom-up needs and capabilities. Additionally, as suggested by our findings, instead of building more social-mediastyle platforms, un-platforming innovations that leverage existing social media channels offer an alternative route to engagement. Un-platformed design is a conceptualization of coordinated participation in social media technologies, [71]. This study provides three exemplar projects in participatory health research, connective online learning, and strategic future foresight through the configuration of accessible and well-known social media apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook that act as clear examples of how this could be used. We also emphasize to social computing and HCI4D researchers that by building on existing platforms, practitioners could avoid the pitfalls of developing expensive bespoke solutions that may or may not work.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_8": "The validity of interaction analysis research is mostly achieved through the transparency of research claims [73].

We propose to adopt an argumentative approach to identify which premises allow such legitimization. To showcase this approach, we created four short narratives describing cyberattacks involving generic users and covering different motives for the attacks: profit, recreation, revenge, and ideology. A sample of 16 participants read the four narratives and was afterward interviewed to express their position on the attacks described. All interview transcripts were then analyzed with an argumentative approach, and 15 premises were found to account for the different positions taken.

(We prefer to use the term legitimized over neutralized or justifed/excused because the former term assumes a cognitive model that is not necessary to our purpose; the terms justifed or excused only refer to a subset of neutralization techniques, and are then not adequate to refer to all techniques in general [49].) To showcase this argumentative approach to legitimization, we study the position on cyberattacks of a small sample of university students, who represent a typical participant in the literature on cybercrime [5]. The investigation uses a refexive thematic analysis [6] [7], which is open to the arguments spontaneously used by the participants. The purpose is not to map the entire argumentative space used by university students to make sense of cyberattacks, but to illustrate an argumentative approach and draw some cybersecurity implications from the results.

This allowed them to use the arguments that spontaneously occurred while answering and to take articulated and ambivalent positions as they were considering various sides of the attack. What we valued were the arguments that backed such positions, not the positions themselves. An argumentative method also needs to consider various scenarios in which a controversial behavior can appear.

Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy.

Notoriety, also called prestige, consists of pursuing \"media attention, bragging, and the quest for fame\" ( [45], p. 100). Revenge is the search for compensating a tort sufered by the attacker. We excluded notoriety and curiosity from this original set of four motives because they did not ft our purposes: we were interested in cases involving lay people in the attack and not in a single attacker wanting to gain popularity or test their talent.

Instead, criminals keep some commitments to the dominant values of society and use some techniques to conciliate them with their criminal acts. Sykes and Matza identifed fve such techniques: denying the responsibility, denying the negativity of the efects, turning the victim or the condemners into culprits, or appealing to higher values [53]. Their ideas have been extensively used in the study of criminal behavior, included within various theoretical frameworks [33], and re-elaborated by Scott and Lyman's theory of accounts [49]. They have also been applied to the study of cybercrime, and evidence of recourse to all fve types of neutralization techniques has been found so far in research on hackers [24].

For example, using quantitative interviewing, Semaan et al. [108] investigated whether social media users' interactions could be characterized by deliberative and civic agency. They described deliberation as the presence of reasoned and respectful discussions and civic agency as the ability to interact and participate in the public sphere. Both Friess et al. [48] and Wright et al. [127] developed coding schemes for labeling user content as deliberative based on features such as rationality and constructiveness. Guimaraes et al. [55] formulated the conversational archetypes \"harmony\", \"discrepancy\", \"disruption\", and \"dispute\" to describe online political discourse. Lee et al. [77] connected user behavior on social media such as debating, posting or forwarding news, to features of civic engagement. Connecting online and offline behavior, Hampton et al. [59] investigated the association of social media usage with the level of offline deliberation, which they defined as the propensity to discuss political issues with others. Evidently, prior research that investigates political rhetoric on social media has only used basic conceptualizations of political discourse theories.

Although user comments included central features of each discourse, such as fact-related and structured arguments in deliberation, collective rhetoric in civic discourse, and unsupported, emotional, and identity-related (\"we vs. them\") statements for demagogic discourse, other properties prescribed by theorists to each discourse did not empirically connect to the latent constructs. Nonetheless, there is a sufficient overlap between theoretical conceptions of political discourse and discussions taking place on social media, which also allows us to answer RQ2 -whether a specific part of the platform's digital environment, its available reaction mechanisms, relate to the prevalence of the above political discourse types. On Reddit, subreddit moderators are free to customize the user interface. In particular, moderators can determine the types of reaction mechanisms (upvote, downvote) that subreddit members can use for interacting with other members. This creates a rich Table 4: Magnitude of factor loadings for the expansive and best CFA model. For each discourse type (deliberative, civic, demagogic) we provide which factors are (+) or are not (-) constitutive components. If a factor is part of a model and complies with the minimal theoretic conceptualization it is colored in green. If it is part of the a model but contradicts the theororetic conceptualization it is colored in red. If we were not able to include it in a error-free model it is colored in orange. pool of behavioral data that describe political discourse dynamics in the presence or absence of different reaction mechanisms. To assess this relationship, we created a quantitative model based on a difference in differences (DID) analysis that compares how specific interventions, i.e., the change of available reaction mechanisms by moderators within subreddits, relate to changes in the type of political discourse among users. In general, DID analysis attempts to measure the effects of a sudden change in the environment, policy, or general treatment on a group of individuals or entities [52]. It evaluates how the time-series or observations of a treatment group suddenly change based on a specific intervention, compared to a control group that is not subjected to the treatment. DID largely assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for treated and comparison groups would have followed parallel paths over time, without any significant variation [28]. Therefore, any difference between treatment and control after the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself, revealing causal relations. In our case, although we apply DID and fulfill the parallel-trends assumption in pre-treatment periods, we are still careful in reporting our results, which we claim are mainly observational. Detected associations related only to the specific social media platform and time-periods, and to generate generalized knowledge, more in detail experimentation and research studies need to take place.", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_para_10": "This study investigates essential rhetoric components of deliberation, civic engagement, and demagoguery. Foreshadowing stark differences, demagoguery oversimplifies complex societal issues [57,101]. Demagoguery's rhetoric polarization lays the groundwork for action-based political mobilization: you are either with \"us\" or with \"them\" [63,78]. Civic engagement interactions are unstructured and characterized by multiple forms of communication and action, with its discourse being frequently characterized as \"messy conversation\" that facilitates participation [35]. Civic engagement interactions aim to be inclusive -a key goal of civic engagement movements [89]. Deliberation, from a Habermasian perspective, requires intersubjective propositional knowledge between conversation members [20]. That is, knowledge-claims must fulfill standards of intersubjectivity: ideally, all discussants are able to relate to the beliefs that underlie a proposition. Propositions must be grounded in logical plausibility, factual correctness, and communal narratives. Discussants' claims must have pragmatic value (i.e, \"propositionality\") in order to support the group's goal of reaching an understanding. Only when everyone can relate to the proposed statements, can deliberative rhetoric help solve a social, civil, or communal issue that is important to the group [62].", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_metadata": "Authors: Devamardeep Hayatpur, Haijun Xia, Daniel J.

In 2018 in the U.S., about 6,000 postsecondary schools employed nearly 4 million [70] and served 16.6 million enrolled undergraduate students [71]. These are unlike other workplaces because of their mission of academic freedom -the freedom to teach, to learn, to publish, and to inquire [4,46,72]. Consequently, IT strategies for securing the information network-in-use [73] is likely to center on intrusion detection [30] and to not include top-down methods of controlling user behavior (such as social media use policies, internet firewalls, or monitoring for data loss prevention). Some institutions use a federated IT model, which allows for subunits of the university such as schools or departments to hire IT staff and operate their own systems to, in part, \"enable research, teaching and community service\" [74].

Conversational Question Answering: This is a conversational search task, where the system needs to correctly interpret a question in the context of an ongoing conversation. Most research on conversational QA focuses on conversational response ranking tasks (Dalton et al., 2019(Dalton et al., , 2020(Dalton et al., , 2021 and extractive QA tasks (Choi et al., 2018;Reddy et al., 2019;Qu et al., 2019b;Yeh and Chen, 2019). Qu et al. (2020) were first to define the task of Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (OR-ConvQA), where the system is required to learn to retrieve top relevant passages from a large collection before extracting answers from the passages. To address the ORConvQA task, Qu et al. (2020) proposed a three-stage pipeline: (1) a retriever, (2) a reranker, and (3) a reader. Later, Qu et al. (2021) introduced a learned weakly-supervised training approach to address the problem of accessing gold passages during the training of the model on the OR-CoQA dataset in (Qu et al., 2020). One particular problem is coarse ranking, where the reranker of Qu et al. (2020) only takes the top-ranked passages as input. This makes the whole pipeline suffers from this coarse ranking, especially for situations when the golden passages are not retrieved in the top-ranked passages. Liang et al. (2022) addressed this issue by adding a post-ranker module that can push more relevant passages to the reader. However, these works typically approach reranking and reading as classification tasks to find an answer span for retrieved passages (start/end positions).

In particular, Khashabi et al. (2020) introduced the UnifiedQA model, which has been shown to yield impressive performances on many extractive QA datasets. However, we show that compared to using monoT5 and UnifiedQA separately, a joint learning can enhance the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of a model for the ORConvQA task, since by sharing the learning model the reranker and reader can simultaneously predict the answer and reranking score. Indeed, a joint learning by sharing a single model trained using MTL reduces the memory needs and speeds up inference (Sun et al., 2020;Standley et al., 2020). In addition, we combine the effective monoT5 (to rerank the retrieved passages) and UnifiedQA (to extract the answer from the highest scored passage) models into a strong baseline.

First, the retriever retrieves the top K relevant passages from the collection based on a question and its conversation history. The reranker and the reader then respectively rerank and identify an answer in the top K passages. We also adopt this threestage architecture in our proposed model. However, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the cross-encoder reranker, we consider a two-stage pipeline including a retriever and a reader, as a baseline for comparison with our system. For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever.

This task is an extractive type of QA, meaning that the answer takes the form of a span in the provided passage, and can be successfully tackled by employing an extractive or generative reader. Extractive reader models (Qu et al., 2019a,b;Yeh and Chen, 2019) are typically employed, where the goal is to classify the start and end positions of the answer span in the given passage. In contrast, generative readers (Raffel et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020; have demonstrated impressive results on the extractive QA tasks, where the goal is to generate tokens that are a subset of a passage. Recently, there has been more focus on retrieval as part of the ConvQA pipeline, known as Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering (ORConvQA). In this setting, the ORConvQA system needs to apply the ConvQA model upon passages retrieved from a large collection, given a question, before actually extracting the answer.", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "c0a57b879ee51e1a648012f0276899d6efd35382_title": "Adaptive Scaling for Sparse Detection in Information Extraction", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_6": "where M is the number of tokens in the ground truth answer a, a i is the i th token in a, and a 0 is the beginning of sequence token (<s>). We also consider relevance accuracy and wordlevel F1 scores for selecting the best training model checkpoint during the evaluation step with the development set of the OR-QuAC dataset. Relevance accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the first token generated from the model. The target token is \"true\" (the passage is indeed relevant) or \"false\" (a non-relevant passage). Following Qu et al. (2020), the word-level F1 is calculated by first removing stopwords and then considering the overlapping portion of the words in the prediction and ground truth answer. Prompt: Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to tailor pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has recently become a popular approach for tackling several tasks using a uniform model . To fine-tune the monoQA model for passage reranking and answer extraction, we use Prompt Learning to modify the model input. By doing this, we investigate several prompts in previous works (Nogueira et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020), and for completeness we evaluate all of them in order to choose the most effective. Details of the Prompt Learning and their corresponding experiments and results are provided in Appendix A.2. We do not investigate Prompt Learning for question reformulation since our main contribution focuses on leveraging the output of a generative model for re-ranking and reading. Positive and negative passages: Selecting positive and negative passages is a crucial step for training monoQA. For instance, passages relevant to a question are provided in the ORConvQA task. All other passages in the collection, which are unjudged, can be viewed as non-relevant by default. To cope with this issue, following Yu et al. (2021), we employ a hard negative sampling technique by randomly selecting the negative passage p \u2212 for the question q from the top K retrieved passages by ConvDR. For training monoQA, the output sequence for the positive passage p + begins with the token \"true\" followed by the ground truth answer; the output sequence for the negative passage p \u2212 begins with the token \"false\" followed by \"CANNOTANSWER\". Model initialisation: We consider the use of different models to initialisation monoQA during training, since we propose to combine monoT5 and UnifiedQA to share a single text generation model. Moreover, both monoT5 and UnifiedQA are fine-tuned based on the t5-base model. Therefore, we investigate which of monoT5, UnifiedQA, and t5-base, are suitable for initialising monoQA (see details in Section 4.1).", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_para_12": "Recently, Prompt Learning, which is a method to modify pre-trained language models to downstream tasks by using a task-specific prompt together with the input, has increasingly become a popular approach for tackling several tasks in a uniform model .

To adopt an MTL approach to a text generation model for jointly learning from both passage reranking and answer extraction, the MTL model makes predictions by generating the first token for the passage reranking task and the follow-up tokens for the answer extraction task.

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image.

Pullin and Hennig [22] describe three designs intended to provoke discussion and encourage thought about the complexities of tone of voice and its importance in AAC. In this work, the authors propose that AAC users should be able to author tones of voice and save and share these tones with other AAC users. The tone authoring process was explored through the ToneTable art piece, which accepts speech audio as input and allows ablebodied users to physically manipulate the tone of that speech [1]. While ToneTable provoked critical thought around the expressivity of speech, it was not a system designed for AAC, or intended to be used by people with speech impairments. Pauletto et. al. [19] investigated the design space of integrating emotional TTS into conversational bot systems. They proposed a brief set of possible design approaches for creating an interface for marking up text with speech attributes, though these design suggestions were not intended for use by AAC device users (i.e., design suggestions involving direct manipulation likely will not work well for an eye-gaze user). They also describe possible designs for displaying speech properties in text.", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_para_0": "Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices are technologies that allow people with speech disabilities to communicate. Current speech generating devices (SGD) used for AAC offer little in the way of allowing users to control the expressive nature of the speech rendered from the user's input [11]. This is surprising given that advances in speech synthesis technologies over the past decade have resulted in the development of text-to-speech (TTS) engines capable of rendering speech that exhibits a range of emotions (e.g., CereProc [4], Nuance Loquendo [18], and IBM Watson [30] are commercial speech engines capable of emotional speech synthesis). Additionally, most TTS engines accept Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2] as input, allowing for a degree of control over prosodic features such as the rate of speech, the pitch of the voice, and cadence/pacing of words. The fact that these advances have yet to be incorporated into SGDs in a meaningful way is a major issue for AAC. Recent work such as that of Higginbotham [9], Kane et. al. [11], and Pullin et al. [22] has described the importance of this issue and the need to develop better AAC systems capable of more expressive speech, but to date, there are no research or commercially available AAC devices that provide advanced expressive speech capabilities, with a majority only allowing for basic modification of speech parameters (overall rate and volume) that cannot be varied on-the-fly (as utterances are constructed and played), while not leveraging the capabilities available in modern TTS engines.", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_para_1": "While AAC devices are significantly lacking in the ability to generate expressive speech, a large amount of speech synthesis research has aimed at creating more expressive speech engines [24]. Synthesizing human-quality expressivity in synthetic speech is still an open problem, but significant advances have been made. Speech engines such as Pitrelli et. al.'s [20] have the ability to render speech that listeners can identify as exhibiting several different tones (e.g., \"conveying bad news\" or \"asking yes-no questions\"). Several commercial engines such as the IBM Watson [28], CereVoice [4], and Nuance Loquendo [18] allow for the rendering of emotional synthesized speech. Each of these systems is similar in allowing developers to select between a small set of emotional categories when rendering speech (e.g., CereVoice supports a default voice in addition to \"happy,\" \"sad,\" \"calm,\" and \"cross\"). Recent developments on the MaryTTS engine (an open-source TTS research platform) [14] have extended beyond simply accepting the specification of emotional categories, allowing for emotional tones to be specified with continuous values for emotional dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance [5]. In addition to allowing for the high-level specification of a tone of voice, each of these TTS engines also supports low-level speech modifications through the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2]. SSML is an XML-based language for specifying prosodic information such as the rate of speech, volume, baseline pitch, emphasized words, and pauses.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "60c713cf96246f6b8bbce6d1b713a8f76196cf58_title": "Online Learning Meets Machine Translation Evaluation: Finding the Best Systems with the Least Human Effort", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_para_12": "Add polite probings and explanations to the question Informativeness, Completion Rate [11,45] Add customizations to show the chatbot is actively listening Informativeness, Engagement Duration [65] Set a minimum response length to handle short user input Response Length, Engagement Duration [28] Add customized chatbot responses to handle user digressions Response Length, Engagement Duration, Repetition Rate [55,65,67] Reword the question to make it more acceptable to users Completion Rate, Repetition Rate [11,14,22] Personalize the chat experience, e.g., addressing users their names Completion Rate [14,22,28] Add default empathetic chatbot responses to handle unknown user input Level of Empathy [14,28,70] Customize chatbot responses to give empathetic feedback on user input Level of Empathy [14,70] Remove all the hate or offensive speech Hate Speech Rate [14] Avoid asking private or sensitive information without user consent Privacy Intrusion Rate [14] randomly divided into two groups, 5 in each group.

However, the agent's voice always emanates from the device, even when that information is contextually and spatially relevant elsewhere. Digital Ventriloquism allows smart speakers to render sound onto everyday objects, such that it appears they are speaking and are interactive. This can be achieved without any modification of objects or the environment. For this, we used a highly directional pan-tilt ultrasonic array. By modulating a 40 kHz ultrasonic signal, we can emit sound that is inaudible \"in flight\" and demodulates to audible frequencies when impacting a surface through acoustic parametric interaction. This makes it appear as though the sound originates from an object and not the speaker. We ran a study in which we projected speech onto five objects in three environments, and found that participants were able to correctly identify the source object 92% of the time and correctly repeat the spoken message 100% of the time, demonstrating our digital ventriloquy is both directional and intelligible.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "7e8cd8729e2991942c50804133a88fa11f18587f_title": "The Workplace Playbook VR: Exploring the Design Space of Virtual Reality to Foster Understanding of and Support for Autistic People", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "523fdd5d31f63355bd318dde35a559f4ac5ed7da_title": "Maker Technology and the Promise of Empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "133d4278069bd3eba627611c51a388879e9eae46_title": "What Should I Ask?

Synthesizing human-quality expressivity in synthetic speech is still an open problem, but significant advances have been made. Speech engines such as Pitrelli et. al.'s [20] have the ability to render speech that listeners can identify as exhibiting several different tones (e.g., \"conveying bad news\" or \"asking yes-no questions\"). Several commercial engines such as the IBM Watson [28], CereVoice [4], and Nuance Loquendo [18] allow for the rendering of emotional synthesized speech. Each of these systems is similar in allowing developers to select between a small set of emotional categories when rendering speech (e.g., CereVoice supports a default voice in addition to \"happy,\" \"sad,\" \"calm,\" and \"cross\"). Recent developments on the MaryTTS engine (an open-source TTS research platform) [14] have extended beyond simply accepting the specification of emotional categories, allowing for emotional tones to be specified with continuous values for emotional dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance [5]. In addition to allowing for the high-level specification of a tone of voice, each of these TTS engines also supports low-level speech modifications through the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2].

Current speech generating devices (SGD) used for AAC offer little in the way of allowing users to control the expressive nature of the speech rendered from the user's input [11]. This is surprising given that advances in speech synthesis technologies over the past decade have resulted in the development of text-to-speech (TTS) engines capable of rendering speech that exhibits a range of emotions (e.g., CereProc [4], Nuance Loquendo [18], and IBM Watson [30] are commercial speech engines capable of emotional speech synthesis). Additionally, most TTS engines accept Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) [2] as input, allowing for a degree of control over prosodic features such as the rate of speech, the pitch of the voice, and cadence/pacing of words. The fact that these advances have yet to be incorporated into SGDs in a meaningful way is a major issue for AAC. Recent work such as that of Higginbotham [9], Kane et. al. [11], and Pullin et al. [22] has described the importance of this issue and the need to develop better AAC systems capable of more expressive speech, but to date, there are no research or commercially available AAC devices that provide advanced expressive speech capabilities, with a majority only allowing for basic modification of speech parameters (overall rate and volume) that cannot be varied on-the-fly (as utterances are constructed and played), while not leveraging the capabilities available in modern TTS engines.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "421eddd6a2c771e87e80eb64fb1328de2db51479_para_5": "Many works embed electrical components in objects to make them interactive.

Human bodies accumulate toxic waste and after we die, our \"return\" to nature can thus be harmful. To combat this, a mushroom suit is said to decompose one's body safely by removing or neutralizing toxicity. 9 Hence, the conversation combines the topics of self-identity and climate change. For feasibility, the character \"Flo\" in the conversation below represents a set of 3D printed fowers ( Figure 5), which are added to smart speakers. They are analogous to the Alias technology, which is a 3D printable \"parasite\" (depicted in Figure 6) that can be added on top of a smart speaker to create a \"hacked\" CUI, This can stop smart speakers from listening in on conversations when they are not in use. In addition, Alias can help people to rename their smart speakers without losing their functionality, allowing users to utter custom \"wake words\" or sounds instead of default names, such as \"Hey, Alexa\". For our exploration, we imagine that 3D-printable and customizable fowers would be added to smart speakers; these fowers can talk to present-day people about how and why they grow from human bodies. As discussed above, design fction and speculative design are approaches that could help to shape how interactions with CUIs can be designed. A fctional conversation for this exploration is below (as written by the frst author): We explored a diferent use case for CUIs, as a starting point to challenge our habits. As Refowering Self suggests, we can trigger people's critical refection towards behavioral change by directly involving one's present and future selves. Flo is foremost sharing \"our\" side of the story in its version of the future, i.e., 'sharing advice' [70], rather than directly preaching to a person about what to do. Its repeated use of \"us\", \"our\", \"we\", i.e., as frstperson plural pronouns, takes on a tone of solidarity between our present and future selves, as a message on how \"we are in the together\". The emphasis, again, is in juxtaposing diferent temporal dimensions as an experience that CUIs can foster, which is what prior research has not looked into. Such ludic experiences focus less on sustainable behavior as a \"to-do list\", cf. [72], but as refective conversations in our everyday lives with CUIs.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

The proposed baseline system uses the averaged perceptron algorithm to classify the relation between each event pair into one of the four relation types. We adopted the same train/dev/test split of TB-Dense, where there are 22 documents in train, 5 in dev, and 9 in test. Parameters were tuned on the train-set to maximize its F 1 on the dev-set, after which the classifier was retrained on the union of train and dev. A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used. Note that we do not mean to say that the proposed baseline system itself is better than other existing algorithms, but rather that the proposed annotation scheme and the resulting dataset lead to better defined machine learning tasks.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours.

Cases in which only two annotators agreed on a telicity label (the third annotator may have either disagreed or skipped the clause) are labeled by a fourth independent annotator (the first author), who did not have access to the labels of the first rounds. This second annotation round resulted in 697 further cases in which three annotators gave the same telicity label. Statistics for our final gold standard, which consists of all instances for which at least three out of the four annotators agreed, are shown in Table 1; \"ambiguous\" verb types are those for which the gold standard contains both telic and atelic instances. 510 of the 567 verb types also occur in the InterCorp silver standard, which provides training instances for 69 out of the 70 ambiguous verb types. Finally, there are 446 cases for which no three annotators supplied the same label. Disagreement and skipping was mainly observed for verbs indicating attributions (\"critics claim\" or \"the film uses\"), which can be perceived either as statives or as instances of historic present. Other difficult cases include degree verbs (\"increase\"), aspectual verbs (\"begin\"), perception verbs (\"hear\"), iteratives (\"flash\") and the verb \"do.\" For these cases, decisions how to treat them may have to be made depending on the concrete application; for now, they are excluded from our gold standard. Another source of error is that despite the training, annotators sometimes conflate their world knowledge (i.e., that some events necessarily come to an end eventually, such as the \"swimming in the lake\" in (2)) with the annotation task of determining telicity at a linguistic level.", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_para_1": "Most ER systems consist of a mention model, a context model, and a coherence model (Milne and Witten, 2008;Cucerzan, 2007;Ratinov et al., * Currently at Tel Aviv University \u2020 Currently at IIT Bombay 2011; Hoffart et al., 2011;Hachey et al., 2013).

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_1": "Text Simplification has often been discussed from psychological and linguistic standpoints (L'Allier, 1980;McNamara et al., 1996;Linderholm et al., 2000). A heuristic-based system was first introduced by Chandrasekar and Srinivas (1997) which induces rules for simplification automatically extracted from annotated corpora. Canning and Tait (1999) proposed a modular system that uses NLP tools such as morphological analyzer, POS tagger 1 https://github.com/subramanyamdvss/UnsupNTS plus heuristics to simplify the text both lexically and syntactically. Most of these systems (Siddharthan, 2014) are separately targeted towards lexical and syntactic simplification and are limited to splitting and/or truncating sentences. For paraphrasing based simplification, data-driven approaches were proposed like phrase-based SMT (Specia, 2010;\u0160tajner et al., 2015) or their variants (Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Xu et al., 2016), that combine heuristic and optimization strategies for better TS. Recently proposed TS systems are based on neural seq2seq architecture (Bahdanau et al., 2014) which is modified for TS specific operations (Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017). While these systems produce state of the art results on the popular Wikipedia dataset (Coster and Kauchak, 2011), they may not be generalizable because of the noise and bias in the dataset (Xu et al., 2015) and overfitting. Towards this,\u0160tajner and Nisioi (2018) showed that improved datasets and minor model changes (such as using reduced vocabulary and enabling copy mechanism) help obtain reasonable performance for both in-domain and cross-domain TS.", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_5": "We also compare our approach with existing supervised and unsupervised lexical simplifications like LIGHTLS (Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), Neural Text Simplification or NTS (Nisioi et al., 2017), Syntax based Machine Translation or SBMT (Xu    PBSMT (Wubben et al., 2012). All the systems are trained using the Wikipedia-SimpleWikipedia dataset (Hwang et al., 2015). The test set is same for all of these and our models. Table 2 shows evaluation results of our proposed approaches along with existing supervised and unsupervised alternatives. We observe that unsupervised baselines such as UNMT and USMT often, after attaining convergence, recreates sentences similar to the inputs. This explains why they achieve higher BLEU and reduced worddifference scores. The ST system did not converge for our dataset after significant number of epochs which affected the performance metrics.

This research topic, commonly referred to as ERC, gained popularity when Poria et al. (2017) first applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Jordan, 1997) to multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. This led to many improvements (Zadeh et al., 2018a,b;Hazarika et al., 2018;. Among those,  used 3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) units, one for each context representation target (speaker, utterance, emotion). Studies on ERC applied to text followed, mainly built on an artificial conversation dataset named DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017). (Zhong et al., 2019) incorporated a knowledge base into the network using context-aware attention and hierarchical self-attention using Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Ghosal et al. (2019) uses graph neural networks to deal with context propagation limitations. These approaches in ERC consider the conversational context surrounding the current utterance; on the other hand, some recent studies consider it as a sequence and tackled ERC through a sequence labeling task . We follow this last approach and consider the ERC task as a sequence labeling task. However, these supervised approaches are difficult to use, as it is hard to find a sufficient amount of conversations labeled with emotions. Hence, in this paper, we approach ERC as a few-shot learning problem. -Shot Learning FSL (Miller et al., 2000;Fei-Fei et al., 2006;Lake, 2015) is suitable to tackle this data limitation. It aims at generaliz-ing faster, leading to a lower dependency on data quantity. It is mainly set up through episodic composition (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016) which recreates the few-shot learning setting by working with small training episodes. Several learning methods are based on metric-learning: Siamese Networks, which share some weights, are used to learn a metric between examples (Koch et al., 2015). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2017) use the training examples to find the weighted nearest neighbors (Vinyals et al., 2017). Prototypical Networks Snell et al. (2017) consider averaged class representations from the training examples and a cosine distance to compare the elements to these class representations. Relation networks replace the Euclidean by the deep neural network which aims at training a distance metric (Sung et al., 2018). In this work, we consider approaches based on Prototypical Networks. As Al-Shedivat et al. (2021) recently showed it, such approaches are the most efficient when working with a low amount of training samples. Many variants have been proposed, on different tasks and topics such as relation classification in text (Gao et al., 2019;Hui et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020), sentiment classification in Amazon comments (Bao et al., 2020), named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Perl et al., 2020;Safranchik et al., 2020), or even speech classification in conversation (Koluguri et al., 2020). This surge of interest on applying few-shot learning to these topics can be attributed to specific datasets, such as Few-Rel (Han et al., 2018) for relation classification. While ERC is mainly considered in a fully supervised learning setting, we intend to view it as a few-shot learning sequence labeling class. In this paper, we propose the first few-shot learning approach on ERC using sequence labeling through adapting Prototypical Networks. We compare our method to the original Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) and to a variant dedicated to named entity recognition (Fritzler et al., 2019) that is easily applicable to our task.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_abstract": "Several recent studies on dyadic human-human interactions have been done on conversations without specific business objectives. However, many companies might benefit from studies dedicated to more precise environments such as after sales services or customer satisfaction surveys. In this work, we place ourselves in the scope of a live chat customer service in which we want to detect emotions and their evolution in the conversation flow. This context leads to multiple challenges that range from exploiting restricted, small and mostly unlabeled datasets to finding and adapting methods for such context. We tackle these challenges by using Few-Shot Learning while making the hypothesis it can serve conversational emotion classification for different languages and sparse labels. We contribute by proposing a variation of Prototypical Networks for sequence labeling in conversation that we name ProtoSeq. We test this method on two datasets with different languages: daily conversations in English and customer service chat conversations in French. When applied to emotion classification in conversations, our method proved to be competitive even when compared to other ones.", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "3ac4e5e444ad558575f51a4b547aefb756f3fe34_title": "Learning Transferable Feature Representations Using Neural Networks", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "76a134e245367d2a1d0fc35801a549d47ec98d0a_para_2": "Comparison to supervised learning DailyDialog is used to compare our FSL approach with recent supervised learning results on ERC. As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model.

Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_metadata": "Authors: E.

Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image.

Yet, extreme gender participation disparities exist in which men significantly outnumber women. A central concern has been that due to self-focus bias, these disparities can lead to corresponding gender content disparities, in which content of interest to men is better represented than content of interest to women. This paper investigates the relationship between participation and content disparities in OpenStreetMap. We replicate findings that women are dramatically under-represented as OSM contributors, and observe that men and women contribute different types of content and do so about different places. However, the character of these differences confound simple narratives about self-focus bias: we find that on a proportional basis, men produced a higher proportion of contributions in feminized spaces compared to women, while women produced a higher proportion of contributions in masculinized spaces compared to men.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_4": "In this paper, we contribute to a more complete picture of how peer-produced content is afected by gender-based contribution disparities. We do so by examining the content generated by a large sample of male and female power editors in OSM. Our results support the hypothesis that men and women tend to contribute diferent types of content. We observe this both in terms of the regions where men and women edit (e.g., rural vs. urban) and in terms of the type of content that they contribute (e.g., the specifc spatial entities they add to the database). However, our results also reveal critical complexity in these diferences that belie a simple gender-based self-focus bias interpretation [65,68,92]. In particular, we observed that men disproportionately contribute to entities that critical geographers [65,92] have identifed as being in feminized spaces and women disproportionately contribute entities in masculinized spaces. Additionally, our analyses point to complicated intersectional dynamics, with contributor gender being associated with a likelihood to exacerbate or mitigate other known content biases in OSM (e.g., those related to the rural-urban spectrum [18,55,83]).", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_11": "This frst research question seeks to capture diferences in the geographic context of male and female contributions.

Existing research has situated male and female OSM editors in a position in which we might expect a misalignment between their interest space. If this were true, a solution to any gender-based content disparity might be easy: attract more female editors. As our results show -this simply is not the case. Instead, our fndings reveal that male users are cognizant of at least some of the feminized spaces, and they actively map those facilities. This contradicts the way many prior researchers have been formulating thoughts and discussion of potential improvements to the amount and quality of feminized spaces in OSM [51,65,68,92]. In our dataset, female editors tended to map feminized places to a lesser extent than their male counterparts. As these spaces characterize important facilities for feminine health and nurturing of others, proper representation is necessary. However, our results point out that a straightforward solution like increasing female participation may not ensure increased representation of feminized spaces. We caution that our results should not be interpreted in a way that discourages higher levels of female participation. Rather we need to think critically about ways to increase coverage of under-represented facilities on OSM. One possible approach is the recruitment of male editors as \"allies\" along with more female participants and informing all editors of the state of the repository. Another solution may be to take the \"SuggestBot\" approach [25] and design a content recommendation system that will seek contributors based on location, interests, skills, etc. For example, a local person who is probably aware of nearby childcare centers or maternity clinics may be asked to map those places irrespective of their gender.", "b0abced402bd11a7b43f42e4fd443c9150b4a9b0_para_10": "Much less work has been done on the relationship between participation disparities and content disparities than on those individual disparities themselves.

Self-focus bias has been empirically observed in a number of peer production contexts. For instance, prior work has seen self-focus bias with respect to geography (i.e., people contribute information about places local to them) [28,42,47,100].

The second perspective is contributor-centric: it focuses on editing behavior of the contributors themselves and any diferences that may exist along gender lines with regards to where and what they edit. In this case, the unit of analysis is the contributor (and their gender). If all contributors made the same number of contributions, these two perspectives would produce identical results. However, in social computing and peer production specifcally, this is rarely the case, and certain contributors make orders of magnitude more contributions than others, even among frequent editors [40,58,59,79].

Sequence tagging approaches label words as fluent or disfluent using a variety of different techniques, including conditional random fields (CRF) (Georgila, 2009;Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014), Max-Margin Markov Networks (M 3 N) (Qian and Liu, 2013), Semi-Markov CRF (Ferguson et al., 2015), and recurrent neural networks (Hough and Schlangen, 2015;Zayats et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016). The main benefit of sequential models is the ability to capture longterm relationships between reparandum and repairs. Noisy channel models (Charniak and Johnson, 2001;Johnson and Charniak, 2004;Zwarts et al., 2010;Lou and Johnson, 2017) use the similarity between reparandum and repair as an indicator of disfluency. Parsing-based approaches (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013;Honnibal and Johnson, 2014;Wu et al., 2015;Yoshikawa et al., 2016;Jamshid Lou et al., 2019) jointly perform parsing and disfluency detection. The joint models can capture long-range dependency of disfluencies as well as chunk-level information. However, training a parsing-based model requires large annotated tree-banks that contain both disfluencies and syntactic structures.", "6757225d841451950a5cea245b73e5ff1af34ff1_abstract": "We demonstrate a program that learns to pronounce Chinese text in Mandarin, without a pronunciation dictionary.

As expected, our best FSL model, ProtoSeq, yields lesser performance than supervised approaches. The latter presuppose the availability of a sufficiently large amount of annotated data and their performance thus represents the upper bound of the expected results. More precisely, we focus on the difference between ProtoSeq with a state-of-the-art supervised model, CESTa , which is computation-heavy. Indeed, CESTa is a contextualized emotion sequence tagging model which considers the fusion of a combination of a transformer and BiLSTM as the global context encoder with a recurrent individual context encoder before feeding a CRF layer. CESTa achieves 63% in micro F1-score in a fully supervised learning approach. ProtoSeq, much lighter, achieves a 31% micro F1 score, demonstrating the potential of FSL for sequence labeling when available data is scarce, especially when many supervised approaches obtained F1-scores around 50%. While using the Live Chat Customer Service dataset, we only change the initial embeddings from English to French, and apply the two best models according to 3: CESTa and KET (Zhong et al., 2019). The CESTa implementation yielded inconclusive results 6 , this is why we present the KET results on our specific corpus in Table 4. KET relies on ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), a multilingual knowledge base. Thus, we only switch from GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to French FastText ones in order to ensure comparison with our ProtoSeq model. As expected, performance is lower on the Live Chat Customer Service corpus.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_metadata": "Authors: Jing Ma, Wei Gao, Shafiq R.

Early work transfers between modern English and the Shakespeare style with a phrase-based machine translation system (Xu et al., 2012). Recently, style transfer is more recognized as a controllable text generation problem (Hu et al., 2017), where the style may be designated as sentiment (Fu et al., 2018), tense (Hu et al., 2017), or even general syntax (Bao et al., 2019;. In the above approaches, the training sentences are labeled with style information, but no parallel data are given. Xu et al.

SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA.

At the same time, we aimed through digital technologies to make the bowl unfamiliar, challenging expectations and assumed roles, however in such a way as not to overshadow its familiarity. This approach to defamiliarizing was with the intention of making it simultaneously familiar and strange, and therefore best open to reflection and analysis of the particularities of non-normative perceptions of humantechnology relations and qualities of experience. To support these aims and in keeping with a counterfactual artifact [41] and research product [23], we crafted the Tilting Bowl with a great deal of purpose and quality so it would fit with and be robust enough for everyday settings over time. Additionally, we drew on ideas of unawareness [22], and unselfconscious interaction [38] to guide the design in which the artifact required no human attention nor user interface to function, and the Tilting Bowl suggested more incremental engagements or intersections rather than explicit interaction. Furthermore, it could easily become a part of ad hoc and changing configurations in a home with other objects in what is referred to as ensembles [22,38]. In these respects, the Tilting Bowl was designed specifically to inquire through lived-with experience into the types and qualities of relationships beyond use and functionality that may emerge.", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_para_7": "Postphenomenological studies typically investigate how, in the relations that arise around a technology, a specific \"world\" is constituted, as well as a specific \"subject.\" This characteristic rests on the concept of relational ontology, asserting the hybrid nature of the inseparability of humans and technology. In our case, any understanding of the Tilting Bowl cannot be separated from the particular philosopher and their contexts and vice versa (their \"specific world\"). Additionally, given the concept of multistability, we expected variant interpretations of these hybrid relations that can be as contradictory as they are diverse, yet always represent their \"specific world\". We previously cited broader philosophical framings of HCI [2,5,14,37] that introduce notions of subject-object relations and embodiment. Recent work has investigated how designoriented practice can ground and further inform these notions, particularly embodiment relations, including somaesthetics [14] embodied practice [43] and more closely related investigations of relativistic investigations of wearables [6]. Such efforts hold value and insights for postphenomenological concerns.", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "e1e67cc7591f63a9ede64e808ceb78d0d3509565_title": "Interactive 360-Degree Glasses-Free Tabletop 3D Display", "8382ff3a2db6ce15e0650498162ec47b9c89a47b_para_0": "In addition to our material speculation approach, we recruited trained philosophers who have the competencies (e.g. critical thinking, ethical training, philosophical vocabulary, etc.) to help us speculate, reveal, and describe human-technology relations with the Tilting Bowl.

Co-speculation is the recruiting and participation of study participants who are well positioned to actively and knowingly speculate with us in our inquiry in ways that we cannot alone.

Human bodies accumulate toxic waste and after we die, our \"return\" to nature can thus be harmful. To combat this, a mushroom suit is said to decompose one's body safely by removing or neutralizing toxicity. 9 Hence, the conversation combines the topics of self-identity and climate change. For feasibility, the character \"Flo\" in the conversation below represents a set of 3D printed fowers ( Figure 5), which are added to smart speakers. They are analogous to the Alias technology, which is a 3D printable \"parasite\" (depicted in Figure 6) that can be added on top of a smart speaker to create a \"hacked\" CUI, This can stop smart speakers from listening in on conversations when they are not in use. In addition, Alias can help people to rename their smart speakers without losing their functionality, allowing users to utter custom \"wake words\" or sounds instead of default names, such as \"Hey, Alexa\". For our exploration, we imagine that 3D-printable and customizable fowers would be added to smart speakers; these fowers can talk to present-day people about how and why they grow from human bodies. As discussed above, design fction and speculative design are approaches that could help to shape how interactions with CUIs can be designed. A fctional conversation for this exploration is below (as written by the frst author): We explored a diferent use case for CUIs, as a starting point to challenge our habits. As Refowering Self suggests, we can trigger people's critical refection towards behavioral change by directly involving one's present and future selves. Flo is foremost sharing \"our\" side of the story in its version of the future, i.e., 'sharing advice' [70], rather than directly preaching to a person about what to do. Its repeated use of \"us\", \"our\", \"we\", i.e., as frstperson plural pronouns, takes on a tone of solidarity between our present and future selves, as a message on how \"we are in the together\". The emphasis, again, is in juxtaposing diferent temporal dimensions as an experience that CUIs can foster, which is what prior research has not looked into. Such ludic experiences focus less on sustainable behavior as a \"to-do list\", cf. [72], but as refective conversations in our everyday lives with CUIs. We believe that a myriad of conversational topics and imaginative conversations with CUIs yet to be designed can be our guides.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "4c1c2ed537d18ffc87112ca315f3596775a44284_title": "Acustico: Surface Tap Detection and Localization using Wrist-based Acoustic TDOA Sensing", "bc9ad2654b273fbad5dec0a119c97e5d5d6ff84e_para_2": "The clearest theorization of attitudes as positions in an argumentative space is due to the discursive psychologist Michael Billig, according to whom culture ofers a set of shared and accepted commonplaces [3] both in favor and against a given controversial behavior [3].

Researchers have been working on presenting various methods of projecting viewpoint images from multiple projectors onto a screen with narrow diffusion characteristics [33,19,18,22]. In such a multi-view 3D display, the number of viewpoints is increased to smooth changes between viewpoints, present the binocular parallax, and widen the visual field area. A uniform viewpoint distribution is necessary for extending the viewing zone over 360-degree  horizontal directions around the table. Conventional methods  of expanding the viewing area to 360 degrees around the table   are roughly divided into a time division method, like a rotation mechanism, and a space division method with multiple  displays or projectors. Jones et al. [17] proposed a time division method that presents 360-degree 3D images with a high-speed video projector and a rotating mirror covered with a holographic diffuser. Inoue et al. [14] proposed a rotating screen system that uses a microelectro-mechanical systems spatial light modulator (MEMS SLM). Takaki et al. [45] proposed a configuration that has three projectors and a rotating screen. The systems of Inoue and Takaki both use a screen that is constructed with a Fresnel lens whose optical axis is shifted to focus light at the users' positions. With a configuration that uses a rotating mirror or a screen, the users' hands cannot be brought close to the 3D objects for their own safety. Butler et al. [4] proposed a 360-degree 3D display in which hands can be brought close to a 3D object because there is a rotating screen and a highspeed digital micromirror device (DMD) projector under the two parabolic mirrors placed opposite each other, and the 3D image is imaged in the air.

We placed a diffusion screen at the observation position (about 850 mm from the center of the screen), then projected a uniform white light on the spatially imaged iris plane screen and measured the luminance distribution of the focused image on the diffusion screen with a two-dimensional luminance meter (HI-LAND RISA-COLOR/ONE5). Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the 2D luminance distributions and 1D luminance distributions of one projector. Figure 11 shows results without a diffusion layer, and Figure 12 shows results with a diffusion layer. The horizontal 1D luminance distribution was measured at a height of 1700 mm, and the vertical distribution was measured at the center of the projector. Figure 11 shows that the Fresnel lens collected the light without spreading in the horizontal direction, and Figure 12 shows that the diffusion layer had smooth attenuation characteristics in the horizontal direction. In Figure 12, the height range of upper than half value (blue line) is 1400 mm to 1900 mm, so the distribution widened vertically due to the distortion of the imaged iris plane. This characteristic ensured linear blending even when the users' heights differed.   In the 1D luminance distribution of the screen without diffusion (Figure 11), the width of upper than half value including the peak is about 10 mm (0.7 degrees), and is 100 mm (6.7 degrees) with diffusion ( Figure 12). Since light passes through the diffusion layer twice, the diffusion angle of the diffusion film used in this implementation is estimated to be about 3 degrees. Figure 13 shows one-dimensional luminance distributions by the five adjacent projectors. This figure shows that the screen smoothed the transition between adjacent viewpoint images with viewpoint movement by superimposing the luminance. Figure 14 shows 360-degree photographs of the projected image. The upper in Figure 14 is a checkerboard-pattern 3D cube. This figure shows that the object can be observed from the entire circumference without distortion. The lower in Figure 14 shows that different angle images of car contents corresponding to the viewpoint positions in the horizontal direction were observed. We could also confirm the effect of stereoscopic vision due to binocular parallax and smooth motion parallax in actual observation. Figure 15 shows the users' bones by image recognition in a 360-degree camera image. Human bones are detected despite some distortion in the vertical direction from the image correction of the 360-degree camera. Since the 360-degree camera is mounted at almost the same height as the users' faces, the upper bodies of the standing users can be detected even when the tabletop screen hides the lower bodies of the users. The frame rate of detection was stable at 11 to 13 fps. Figure 16 shows the observed images with and without head tracking when the viewpoint heights were changed to three levels.

Prior implementations of NMN use pre-defined and fixed textual inputs in their module instantiation. This necessitates a large number of modules as they lack the ability to share weights and exploit associations between similar textual contexts (e.g. \u201cdark cube on the left\u201d vs. \u201cblack cube on the left\u201d). In this work, we address these limitations and evaluate the impact of contextual clues in improving the performance of NMN models. First, we address the problem of fixed textual inputs by parameterizing the module arguments. This substantially reduce the number of modules in NMN by up to 75% without any loss in performance. Next we propose a method to contextualize our parameterized model to enhance the module\u2019s capacity in exploiting the visiolinguistic associations. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art NMN model on CLEVR-Ref+ dataset with +8.1% improvement in accuracy on the single-referent test set and +4.3% on the full test set. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextualization provides +11.2% and +1.7% improvements in accuracy over prior NMN models on CLOSURE and NLVR2. We further evaluate the impact of our contextualization by constructing a contrast set for CLEVR-Ref+, which we call CC-Ref+. We significantly outperform the baselines by as much as +10.4% absolute accuracy on CC-Ref+, illustrating the generalization skills of our approach.", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_4": "Neural Module Networks. Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse textual expressions as executable programs composed of learnable neural modules (Andreas et al., 2016b;Johnson et al., 2017a,b;Hu et al., 2017a). Each of these modules are specialized to compute basic reasoning tasks and can be assembled to perform complex and compositional reasoning. (Andreas et al., 2016b) used dependency trees (Zhu et al., 2013) to generate the execution layouts. (Andreas et al., 2016a) proposed dynamic NMNs that learns and adapts the structure of the execution layouts to the question. (Johnson et al., 2017b) proposed homogeneous (IEP) and generic neural modules, unlike fixed and hand-crafted neural module, in which the semantics of each neural module is learnt during training. IEP model achieves promising performance on CLEVR dataset. (Liu et al., 2019) proposed IEP-Ref by extending IEP model to CLEVR-Ref+ dataset and outperformed all the prior works. Although, compositional by design, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow and fail to ground novel combinations of known linguistic constructs (Bahdanau et al., 2019). The major difference between our work and these prior works of NMN is that we explicitly parametrize and contextualize the neural modules by jointly attending over the visual and textual inputs.

Recently, neural module networks (NMN; Andreas et al. 2016b;Hu et al. 2017b;Liu et al. 2019) have been gaining popularity as a promising approach for solving this task. Briefly, NMN models use an explicit modular reasoning process where a program generator first analyzes the input referring expression and predicts a sequence of learnable neural modules (e.g. count, filter, compare). Next, an execution engine dynamically assembles these modules to predict the target object in the image. Such a module based hierarchical reasoning process helps NMNs in providing high model interpretability and therefore facilitates in improving overall trust in the model (Andreas et al., 2016b;Akula et al., 2020b).", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_2": "Moreover, in the prior implementations of NMN such as IEP-Ref (Johnson et al., 2017b;Liu et al., 2019), the modules in execution engine are not conditioned on the surrounding context of their textual input in the expression. This is problematic as the modules are not given the opportunity to watch the neighborhood of textual input that helps in extracting the informative visiolinguistic context from the module's visual input. For example, the module filter_color[dark] needs to pick a black colored cube or a red-colored cube depending on the neighborhood context in the expression (e.g. \"the dark thing that is hardly visible\" vs. \"the dark thing among the red cubes\") and the type of cubes available in its visual input. Few implementations of NMN such as FiLM (Perez et al., 2018) and N2NMN (Hu et al., 2017a) parametrize the surrounding context of their textual input. However, the visiolinguistic context in these modules is rather shallow as they cannot jointly co-attend over potential objects of interest directly from the visual input and textual inputs.", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_para_3": "Referring Expression Recognition.

The framework is trained on top of three individual models: the questioner (QGen), the guesser, and the oracle. The guesser returns an object distribution given a history of question-answer pairs that are generated by the questioner and the oracle respectively. These distributions are used for calculating the information gain of the question-answer pair. The information gain and distribution of probabilities given by the Guesser are used either as a reward or optimized as a loss function with global rewards for training the questioner.", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_4": "Nevertheless, while this approach can model more complex interactions, some of these can only occur indirectly inside the backtracking of their beam search. Furthermore, the disambiguation involves an auto-regressive decoding that, although mitigated by later efforts (De Cao et al., 2021a), has intrinsic speed limitations. In contrast, here we propose an extractive formulation, where a model receives as input the mention, its context and the text representation of each candidate, and has to extract the span corresponding to the representation of the entity that best matches the (mention, context) pair under consideration. Note that this differs from the aforementioned cross-encoder formulations (Logeswaran et al., 2019; where, instead, each entity was encoded together with the (mention, context) pair, but independently from all the other entities.

The linear probes indicate that the information about what type of reasoning is required for a task, which is hypothesized to be encoded in the models, was distinctly encoded in each model, but to a greater extent in the decomposable attention model. The connection between the pathways and the linear probes was less strong, however. This indicates that despite the models having an encoding of the knowledge observed by the probe, it is likely a byproduct of a different function that is being approximated by the neural network. The pathways were created by analyzing which neurons behave cohesively, indicating a subprocess within the network. However, these subprocesses do not correspond strongly to any of the tested features.

However, for the domain divergence objective, the common part contributes positively (i.e., tries to minimize divergence by maximizing the domain regressor's loss); whereas, the source specific part contributes negatively (i.e., tries to maximize divergence by minimizing domain regressor's loss) Generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) build generative models to synthesize samples and falls closely in the same cat-egory due to the similar method of measuring and minimizing the discrepancy between the feature distributions. The GAN model learns the representation in generative mode while our work is based on discriminative learning.", "d472624d1ab5298e0d7bc5151cf416bb55dc3440_title": "DataHop: Spatial Data Exploration in Virtual Reality", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_abstract": "Neural module networks (NMN) are a popular approach for grounding visual referring expressions. Prior implementations of NMN use pre-defined and fixed textual inputs in their module instantiation. This necessitates a large number of modules as they lack the ability to share weights and exploit associations between similar textual contexts (e.g. \u201cdark cube on the left\u201d vs. \u201cblack cube on the left\u201d). In this work, we address these limitations and evaluate the impact of contextual clues in improving the performance of NMN models. First, we address the problem of fixed textual inputs by parameterizing the module arguments. This substantially reduce the number of modules in NMN by up to 75% without any loss in performance. Next we propose a method to contextualize our parameterized model to enhance the module\u2019s capacity in exploiting the visiolinguistic associations. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art NMN model on CLEVR-Ref+ dataset with +8.1% improvement in accuracy on the single-referent test set and +4.3% on the full test set. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextualization provides +11.2% and +1.7% improvements in accuracy over prior NMN models on CLOSURE and NLVR2. We further evaluate the impact of our contextualization by constructing a contrast set for CLEVR-Ref+, which we call CC-Ref+. We significantly outperform the baselines by as much as +10.4% absolute accuracy on CC-Ref+, illustrating the generalization skills of our approach.", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "27f12cd65489a8e1e2e38b4ebe89e72c14598e9e_title": "SynchroMouse: A Game of Improvised Joint Action", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_para_4": "Results.

However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines.

They were given additional time to play with Juji and get familiar with various design features. Each designer was then given the baseline chatbot for them to import into their own account so they could preview and improve the baseline. They also had access to the report dashboard and all the interviewee responses extracted from the 128 conducted chatbot interviews as described in section 3.2. They were asked to describe the good and bad aspects of the baseline chatbot. Next, they were asked to improve the baseline chatbot along three dimensions: user response quality, user experience, and ethics. They were allowed to use any chatbot customizations (e.g., rewording a question or customizing a chatbot's reactions to user input) as long as all the original interview questions and the question order were kept. All the designers in one group (Group B, w/ iChatProfile) were also given iChatProfile to view the generated profile of the baseline chatbot and corresponding design suggestions, while the other group (Group A, w/o iChatProfile) was not given the tool but only the interviewee responses .

These characteristics often result in deficient performance of neural network based detection models. In this paper, we propose adaptive scaling, an algorithm which can handle the positive sparsity problem and directly optimize over F-measure via dynamic cost-sensitive learning. To this end, we borrow the idea of marginal utility from economics and propose a theoretical framework for instance importance measuring without introducing any additional hyper-parameters.

Algorithm-level approaches attempt to choose an appropriate inductive bias on models or algorithms to make them more suitable on data imbalance condition, including instance weighting (Ting, 2002;Lin et al., 2017), cost-sensitive learning (Anand et al., 1993;Domingos, 1999;Sun et al., 2007;Krawczyk et al., 2014) and active learning approaches (Ertekin et al., 2007a,b;Zhu and Hovy, 2007). F-Measure Optimization. Previous research on F-measure optimization mainly fell into two paradigms (Nan et al., 2012): 1) Decisiontheoretic approaches (DTA), which first estimate a probability model and find the optimal predictions according to that model (Joachims, 2005;Jansche, 2005Jansche, , 2007Dembczynski et al., 2011;Busa-Fekete et al., 2015;Natarajan et al., 2016). The main drawback of these methods is that they need to estimate the joint probability with exponentially many combinations, thus make them hard to use in practice; 2) Empirical utility maximization (EUM) approaches, which adapt approximate methods to find a best classifier in hypothesises (Musicant et al., 2003;Chinta et al., 2013;Parambath et al., 2014;Narasimhan et al., 2014). However, EUM methods depend on thresholds or costs that are not known a priori so time-consuming searching on large development set is required. Our adaptive scaling algorithm is partially inspired by EUM approaches, but is based on the marginal utility framework, which doesn't introduce any additional hyper-parameter or searching procedure. Neural Network based Event Detection. Event detection is a typical task of detection problems. Recently neural network based methods have achieved significant progress in Event Detection. CNNs (Chen et al., 2015;Nguyen and Grishman, 2015) and Bi-LSTMs (Zeng et al., 2016;Yang and Mitchell, 2017) are two effective and widely used models. Some improvements have been made by jointly predicting triggers and arguments  or introducing more complicated architectures to capture larger scale of contexts Ghaeini et al., 2016).", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "d68255e8210843118d641175105e69686ad5b40f_title": "Mind the Context: The Impact of Contextualization in Neural Module Networks for Grounding Visual Referring Expressions", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "894009cd79adab9d32132ea7ea79c8c028d68d3b_title": "Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_title": "PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_title": "Word and Document Embedding with vMF-Mixture Priors on Context Word Vectors", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "2139c564a8fdc649727e5deb7f2ca468874c7bdd_title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement", "9521ca90922348d5e5f110b8968c4ed66542872e_title": "PathQG: Neural Question Generation from Facts", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "2941b843d309576971106d520fd4b848a113504f_title": "Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_title": "bert2BERT: Towards Reusable Pretrained Language Models", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "d6e0d5babcec1fa18002876e7a437c0dcb4b56cf_title": "Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_para_5": "To evaluate our interpretation technique on real world data, we applied our method on four trained models over two tasks: recognizing textual entailment using the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference corpus (Williams et al., 2018) and named entity recognition using the CoNLL 2003 data (Sang and Meulder, 2003) for English NER.

Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance.

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al.

It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent pieces of evidence, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidence as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidence considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the embedded evidence. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_1": "A recent trend is that researchers are trying to establish more objective tasks and evidence-based verification solutions, which focus on the use of evidence obtained from more reliable sources, e.g., encyclopedia articles, verified news, etc., as an important distinguishing factor (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018). Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_3": "More recently, semantic matching methods were proposed to retrieve evidence from relatively trustworthy sources such as checked news and Wikipedia articles. Popat et al. (2018) attempted to debunk false claims by learning claim representations from relevant articles using an attention mechanism to focus on words that are closely related to the claim. Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules. Similar pipelines were developed by most of the participating teams (Nie et al., 2019;Padia et al., 2018;Alhindi et al., 2018;Hanselowski et al., 2018) in FEVER shared task (Thorne et al., 2018b). Apart from the document retrieval function, our model is end-to-end and aims to learn sentence-level evidence with a hierarchical attention framework.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_5": "Our approach exploits and integrates two core semantic relations: 1) coherence of the sentences given the claim; 2) entailment relation between the claim and each sentence, which are described more specifically below. Coherence Evaluation: According to the coherence theory of truth, the truth of any (true) proposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of propositions (Young, 2018). In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency. Textual Entailment: Entailment is used to measure whether a piece of evidence semantically infers a given claim. We propose an entailmentbased attention component that can be pre-trained to capture entailment relations (Dagan et al., 2010;Bowman et al., 2015) based on sentence pairs labeled with NLI-specific classes: entails, contradicts and neutral. This pre-trained component together with the entire claim verification framework then will be trained end-to-end to attend on the salient sentences for inferring the claim.", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_para_3": "Our experiments adopt the popular three-stage pipeline of FEVER task, comprising document selection, evidence sentence extraction, and claim verification (Thorne et al., 2018b).

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables.

For the retriever, existing works (Qu et al., 2020(Qu et al., , 2021Liang et al., 2022;Yu et al., 2021) have focused on using bi-encoder dense retrieval (a question encoder and a passage encoder), which applies neural contextual language models, such as ALBERT or BERT, for encoding the question and passage into low-dimensional vectors and computing their relevance scores. For example, Yu et al. (2021) proposed ConvDR, which encodes the question and its history in a dense vector learned with a teacher-student model to mimic a dense representation of the manually rewritten question. ConvDR has also been shown to outperform other retriever models for conversational search such as sparse BM25, and bi-encoders using ALBERT (Qu et al., 2020) or BERT . Due to the good effectiveness of bi-encoder dense retrievers for passage retrieval, we adapt this type of retrieval model as our retriever.

Most earlier approaches to NER are based on conventional structured prediction models such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001;Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), relying on handcrafted features which can be designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Yang and Cardie, 2012;Passos et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2015).

Two notable approaches, namely INIT (parameter initialization) and MULT (multitask learning), have been proposed for studying the transferrability of neural networks under tasks such as sentence (pair) classification (Mou et al., 2016) and sequence labeling (Yang et al., 2017b).

The MULT method, on the other hand, simultaneously trains two models using both source and target data respectively, where some parameters are shared across the two models during the learning process.

However, very recent empirical studies show that some self-attention heads make little contribution and can be pruned as redundant heads. This work takes a novel perspective of identifying and then vitalizing redundant heads. We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads. Experimental results on widely adopted WMT14 and WMT16 English to German and English to Czech language machine translation validate the RHE effectiveness.", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_para_1": "UBT (Wu et al., 2015) 90.3 80.5 85.1 Bi-LSTM (Zayats et al., 2016) 91.8 80.6 85.9 NCM (Lou and Johnson, 2017) --86.8 Transition-based (Wang et al., 2017) 91.1 84.1 87.5 Self-supervised  93.4 87.3 90.2 Self-training (Lou and Johnson, 2020) Table 4: Comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods on the Switchboard test set.

In the case of the word embedding models, we create document vectors in the same way as we do for our model, by simply replacing the role of target word vectors with document word vectors. In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations. We tuned the dimensionality of the embedding from the pool {100, 150, 200} and the number of vMF mixture components from the pool {200, 500, 800}.", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_para_4": "In the absence of any other direct baseline for end-to-end TS, we consider the following unsupervised baselines.

Thanks to the advent of large pretrained language models, this group has recently witnessed a significant improvement in performances, which are nowadays on par with, or even above, those achieved by state-of-the-art global systems (Shahbazi et al., 2019). These approaches usually frame ED as a multi-label classification problem (Broscheit, 2019) and a diverse set of formulations have been proposed. Among these, the bi-encoder paradigm (Bromley et al., 1994;Humeau et al., 2020) has been particularly successful (Gillick et al., 2019;Tedeschi et al., 2021;Botha et al., 2020): here, two encoders are trained to learn vector representations in a shared space for mentions in context and entities, respectively.

However, with our word adaptation layer, it opens the opportunity to use domainspecific embeddings. Our approach also addresses the domain shift problem at both input and output level by re-constructing target models with our specifically designed adaptation layers. The hyper-parameter in our proposed methods and in MULT both control the knowledge transfer from source domain in the transfer learning process. While our method works on top of an existing pre-trained source model directly, MULT needs re-training with source domain data each time they train a target model. Fang and Cohn (2017) add an \"augmented layer\" before their final prediction layer for crosslingual POS tagging -which is a simple multilayer perceptron performing local adaptation for each token separately -ignoring contextual information. In contrast, we employ a BLSTM layer due to its ability in capturing contextual information, which was recently shown to be crucial for sequence labeling tasks such as NER (Ma and Hovy, 2016;Lample et al., 2016).

However, Net2Net randomly selects the neurons to be split. To handle this problem, some works (Wu et al., , 2020bWang et al., 2019b;Wu et al., 2020a) leverage a functional steepest descent idea to decide the optimal subset of neurons to be split. The pruning technique (Han et al., 2015) is also introduced for reusable neural networks (Feng and Panda, 2020).

However, although simple and yet powerful enough to push scores past 90% inKB Micro F 1 on standard benchmarks, this formulation suffers from a number of downsides. First, the actual disambiguation is only modeled through a dot product between independent mention and entity vectors, which may not capture complex mention-entity interactions. Second, from a computational perspective, entities are represented through high-dimensional vectors that are cached in a pre-computed index. Thus, classifying against a large KB has a significant memory cost that, in fact, scales linearly with respect to the number of entities. Besides this, adding a new entity also requires modifying the index itself. To address these issues, De Cao et al. (2021b) have recently proposed an auto-regressive formulation where, given mentions in their context, models are trained to generate, token-by-token, the correct entity identifiers. 1 While this approach has addressed the aforementioned issues effectively, it requires an autoregressive decoding process, which has speed implications, and, what is more, does not let the model see its possible output choices, something that has shown significant potential in other semantic tasks (Barba et al., 2021a). In this work, we focus on these shortcomings and, inspired by this latter research trend, propose Extractive Entity Disambiguation (EXTEND), the first entity disambiguator that frames ED as a text extraction task. Given as input a context c m in which a mention m occurs, along with a text representation for each of the possible candidates e 1 , . . . , e n , a model has to extract the span associated with the text representation of the entity that best suits m. We implement this formulation through 2 architectures: i) a Transformer system (Vaswani et al., 2017; that features an almost identical modeling power to that of previous works, and ii) a variant that relaxes the computational requirements of our approach when using common Transformer-based architectures. Evaluating our two systems over standard benchmarks, we find our formulation to be particularly suited to ED. In particular, when restricting training resources to the AIDA-CoNLL dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) only, EXTEND appears to be significantly more data-efficient than its alternatives, surpassing them by more than 6 inKB Micro F 1 points on average across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, when pre-training on external ED data as in De Cao et al. (2021b), our system sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 6 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 overall and 1.1 when moving out of domain.

At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_para_4": "Nevertheless, while this approach can model more complex interactions, some of these can only occur indirectly inside the backtracking of their beam search. Furthermore, the disambiguation involves an auto-regressive decoding that, although mitigated by later efforts (De Cao et al., 2021a), has intrinsic speed limitations. In contrast, here we propose an extractive formulation, where a model receives as input the mention, its context and the text representation of each candidate, and has to extract the span corresponding to the representation of the entity that best matches the (mention, context) pair under consideration. Note that this differs from the aforementioned cross-encoder formulations (Logeswaran et al., 2019; where, instead, each entity was encoded together with the (mention, context) pair, but independently from all the other entities.

We interview 23 workgroup members about their account sharing practices at a U.S. university. Our study is the first to explicitly compare IT and non-IT observations of account sharing as a \"normal and easy\" workgroup practice, as well as to compare student practices with those of full-time employees. We contrast our results with those in prior works and offer recommendations for security design and for IT messaging. Our findings that account sharing is perceived as low risk by our participants and that security is seen as secondary to other priorities offer insights into the gap between technical affordances and social needs in an academic workplace such as this.?", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_12": "When we compare our results with those in five prior works that deal with account sharing (Table  5), we find that our study's results differ most strongly for three themes: (1) that account sharing is motivated by the view that security is secondary to job duties; (2) that account sharing also is motivated by a perception that it is low risk; and (3) that account sharing differs by job categories (IT vs. non-IT, and student vs. full-time). Table 5: We summarize the similarities and disconnects with five prior works on account sharing (Song et al. [57], Park et al. [49], Bartsch and Sasse [7], Kaye [33], and Weirich et al. [64]). Our comparisons of account sharing by job categories is the most novel, followed by our findings that university participants see account sharing as low risk, and that they see security as secondary to job duties.

We also add qualitative insights from this setting to complement recent survey studies of account sharing within social contexts and extend findings from older studies of account sharing to the age of widespread personal account use. We found, as prior work did, that users in this university community share accounts to streamline workflows [57] and to save money [11,57]. These findings seem to demonstrate similar \"shadow security\" practices through temporary access as described in Kirlappos and Sasse [34] (to streamline workflows) and in Bartsch and Sasse [7] (to save money). We summarize comparisons of our results with themes in five prior works that deal with account sharing in Section 5.1.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_8": "With our study, we seek to add to knowledge of attitudes and behaviors in a university setting and to add insights that are not focused on 2FA use as with Colnago et al. [14] We document end users' awareness, motivation and knowledge of how to comply with their university's information security policies, adding a ground-level perspective to Weidman and Grossklags' review of such policies [63]. Our study contributes what appears to us as the first study of account sharing in a university setting.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_15": "Few non-IT university workers in our study were consciously aware of policies and trainings for account sharing limits and procedures, and many said they are not easily accessible or comprehensible, echoing Weidman and Grossklags' findings [55,56]. The picture that emerges from our interview data ( Figure 1) contradicts our expectation that cybersecurity policies and procedures also would impact workgroups from a university IT and from personal level. In fact, many non-IT participants hold higher standards for their personal accounts versus their shared work accounts, since they feel that their work accounts do not contain financial or confidential data that are of interest to attackers. While their individual accounts may be of low interest, the network that the accounts are connected to is of high interest to attackers; a research university such as this controls hundreds of millions of dollars in financial assets and a substantial amount of sensitive data and intellectual property. Figure 1: A diagram of (above) the expectation that university messaging on cybersecurity will directly reach workgroups, and those workgroups and personal behaviors will reinforce each other; (below) the reality that emerges from our interview data is of disconnection. Our participants indicated that university policies are unknown to workgroups and strong personal practices do not permeate through the workgroup. The main influencer is what the workgroup as a collective decides upon.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_7": "Some recent work has explicitly examined the usability of security in a university setting. Colnago et al. [14] documented the attitudes and behaviors surrounding twofactor authentication (2FA) as it was rolled out at a large research university. Regarding account sharing, the authors found that 2FA interfered with the ability of some students to share their financial accounts with parents, because the parents could only use the shared password at a time when the students were available to answer the 2FA push notification. They also found that some students were more concerned about a physical attack, such as someone getting into their computer if they walked away from it, than a remote and opportunistic attack. Around the same time, Weidman and Grossklags [62,63] sought and analyzed the information security policies of 200 top universities. They found that about half did not make their security policies publicly accessible, and that these policies were seldom consistent or shared source materials; moreover, the policies tended to be difficult to read, lacking in emotional language, and worded ambiguously and/or tentatively, such that the takeaways were unclear.", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_14": "We suspect the discrepancies in findings of risk perception are driven partly by differences in security cultures for the university in our study vs. the organizations in prior studies. Indeed, we found that account sharing here was evidence of trust as a social norm, of two different types: trust in colleagues, and trust in authorities (university participants' quotes regarding trust in IT or \"the system\"). The latter type of trust seems an extension of the paternalistic norms of educational enterprises, in which authorities are assumed to provide a level of care, protection and guidance akin to that of a parent [6,9]. Only the former type seems similar to themes of \"demonstrating trust\" in prior works about account sharing, because those data appeared to involve others who were peers or near-peers in a social unit. Peers at work differ from authorities in that their interactions involve social pressures and mutual monitoring in pursuit of common or overlapping productivity goals [45].", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_0": "devices permitted under Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) or Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) policies [69]. Despite IT accommodations like these, the gap between technical affordances and social needs [1] often forces workers who are security-conscious [2,31] to make compromises with official IT policies and procedures in order to get their jobs done [7]. One compromise is account sharing, in which more than one person uses the same username and password to access a work resource [57]. In fact, a recent survey of gig workers who also are employed in settings such as retail or shipping found that sharing accounts designed for individual use is now accepted as a \"norm\" [57].", "d1caa02943506bd9be682c4abd5e540388d69e23_title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_6": "Kaye [33] found that users shared passwords for personal email, Facebook and work accounts with others who they trusted and shared responsibilities with, chiefly spouses, partners and colleagues.

[27] found that invoking a reciprocity social norm, through giving a small incentive, increased people's willingness to share passwords. Among studies of romantic partners sharing accounts [41,42,49], Park et al. found that romantic couples' motivations to share accounts were both logistical and emotional, but that some chose to hide accounts to hide other relationships, to avoid conflict, or because they saw the accounts as irrelevant to the relationship.

In 2018 in the U.S., about 6,000 postsecondary schools employed nearly 4 million [70] and served 16.6 million enrolled undergraduate students [71]. These are unlike other workplaces because of their mission of academic freedom -the freedom to teach, to learn, to publish, and to inquire [4,46,72]. Consequently, IT strategies for securing the information network-in-use [73] is likely to center on intrusion detection [30] and to not include top-down methods of controlling user behavior (such as social media use policies, internet firewalls, or monitoring for data loss prevention). Some institutions use a federated IT model, which allows for subunits of the university such as schools or departments to hire IT staff and operate their own systems to, in part, \"enable research, teaching and community service\" [74]. They will tolerate or encourage CYOD and self-management of IT for their workforce, which is a mix of traditional in-office employees and of remote and/or mobile workers such as \"digital nomads\" [16,29,40]. For non-IT users, this could result in \"shadow security,\" workarounds to official rules and setups that help employees manage the risks they understand while getting their jobs done [35]. Academic freedom complicates the implementation and communication of university IT policies [14,62,63] and has led to conflicts with copyright holders over campus use of peer-to-peer file sharing [51].

In fact, the reasons and contexts for reciprocated smartphone use can be quite similar to those of initial self-initiated smartphone use (e.g., disengagement).

Far from being possessed in advance, positions emerge from the very process of trying diferent arguments and testing their suitability and implications; this process, as in dialectic philosophy [16], generates the knowledge needed to come to terms with a given controversy.

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

Although there are guidelines [36,37] that provide best practices for authoring alt text descriptions, researchers have found that these practices are often poorly suited for describing people who appear in images due to the complexities of representing gender, race, and disability [3]. Researchers have also noted that one-size-fts-all image descriptions are inadequate for addressing the information preferences of blind and low vision people, which necessitates the need for contextually relevant image descriptions [27,28]. Context can be particularly important when determining how to describe images of people, as research by Bennet et al.

We also interviewed seven sighted individuals to explore their thoughts on authoring alt text for profile pictures. Our findings suggest that detailed image descriptions and user narrated alt text can provide screen reader users enjoyable and informative experiences when exploring profile pictures. We also identified mismatches between how sighted individuals would author alt text with what screen reader users prefer to know about profile pictures.

Our work builds upon and extends these prior eforts by focusing on the information screen reader users prefer to know when encountering profle pictures, and on the perspectives sighted individuals have around what should be included in profle picture descriptions. The focus of our work was to expand our understanding of how the appearance of profle pictures within diferent contexts infuences the information needs of screen reader users, ultimately so that applications and platforms can provide relevant image descriptions when and how users want them. Also, by understanding the misconceptions sighted individuals have regarding profle picture alt text, we can think about how to prompt users to author descriptions that meet the needs of screen reader users. In this section, we discuss the role of profle pictures as a form of identity representation; how context infuenced information needs; the disjointed image description experiences between screen reader and sighted users; the potential of narrated image descriptions; and the unique image description challenges posed by avatars.", "e177cbffa664e1f1d62f4213f89de8f3fbd4d9ec_para_7": "We found that our sighted participants were often unsure about what should be included in image descriptions, and frequently questioned the importance of various details. For example, the comment by SP7 that backgrounds were not important is in opposition to the opinions expressed by our screen reader participants, who found value in the social signals provided by descriptions of backgrounds. Overall, the tendency was for our sighted participants to suggest that less information be provided. An issue at play is that our sighted participants' views on what should be included in image descriptions were typically based on their personal opinions, not on what they thought might be useful to screen reader users. Mismatches between screen reader and sighted users is an example of Problem 1 of \"Why CSCW applications fail\" presented by Grudin [11]: the disparity between who does the work and who gets the beneft. This problem is often exacerbated in accessibility contexts since the people who do the work often do not understand the needs or perspectives of the people who will beneft. Prior research has explored the efectiveness of various methods for authoring alt text for diferent types of imagery, including memes [8], charts [20], and images in PowerPoint [18].

For example, SRU1 mentioned that some descriptive information might be conveyed, but that there was no way to verify the validity of the description: \"Sometimes you may get a little quick description of the graphic with the person standing outside or something like that.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ofered by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) instructs content creators to provide text alternatives for non-text content, but the instructions are general and lack the specifcity that can be helpful when creating an image description [36]. For example, the guidelines propose that alt text for \"informative images\", like photos and illustrations, \"should be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image\" [36]. The National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) provides general guidelines for alt text, such as consider your audience, be concise, and be objective, as well as specifc description guidelines for diferent types of visual media, like maps, diagrams, and photographs [37]. Researchers have proposed strategies that build upon and improve the use of these guidelines in practice. Morash et al.

Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing, but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs, we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback. Our field study demonstrated the value of providing better and more extensive writing support on SNSs, and the potential of AI for building a more inclusive Internet.", "057acaf6619c0bb9f53c8fdbad3ed5efbea68a31_title": "\"Could You Define That in Bot Terms\"?: Requesting, Creating and Using Bots on Reddit", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "1c23a864a00ca1cc72f8b2ac74e6bd9e7e5ca3ed_title": "Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences", "af4db070898b1f04df40f7e850500b6adb26c30e_title": "Tracking and Reporting Asthma Data for Children", "2f918e0232d3b7c2cabecaaa7edc976e068ce0c6_title": "Upvotes?

The technical features of digital artifacts (e.g., the downvoting functionality) are exactly the same to each user. However, different users may perceive and use such technical features differently resulting in the different interaction affordances that a common technical artifact provides to users. The key takeaway from this conceptual distinction is that the technical features of an artifact do not necessarily determine how users relate to and use the artifact.

Studies such as Adams (1996), Smith (2001), and Levitan (2019) show that verbal leak-age cues can be found through psycholinguistic dictionaries such as the LIWC lexicon (Pennebaker et al., 1999), LDI (Bachenko et al., 2008;Enos, 2009), and Harbingers (Niculae et al., 2015).", "b51770fffaa319dc7d01d0c59406f8aab6d58c6a_abstract": "Although many studies use the LIWC lexicon to show the existence of verbal leakage cues in lie detection datasets, none mention how verbal leakage cues are influenced by means of data collection, or the impact thereof on the performance of models. In this paper, we study verbal leakage cues to understand the effect of the data construction method on their significance, and examine the relationship between such cues and models\u2019 validity. The LIWC word-category dominance scores of seven lie detection datasets are used to show that audio statements and lie-based annotations indicate a greater number of strong verbal leakage cue categories. Moreover, we evaluate the validity of state-of-the-art lie detection models with cross- and in-dataset testing. Results show that in both types of testing, models trained on a dataset with more strong verbal leakage cue categories\u2014as opposed to only a greater number of strong cues\u2014yield superior results, suggesting that verbal leakage cues are a key factor for selecting lie detection datasets.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_title": "Respecifying Phubbing: Video-Based Analysis of Smartphone Use in Co-Present Interactions", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_title": "Synthesizing Stroke Gestures Across User Populations: A Case for Users with Visual Impairments", "cd1901cb9b9f4359c8fe5fc7d3b6c2738ec01945_title": "Contextual Autonomy Support in Video Game Play: A Grounded Theory", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "80df46dbcb20deaaad29089dd970212fc6a23de4_title": "Insights and Opportunities for HCI Research into Hurricane Risk Communication", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "dfe4e373bab4f089ac5f6fc1990a5d195d4d85b8_title": "On Looking at the Vagina through Labella", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_para_1": "Many studies have elucidated the communicative functions of oral code-switching.

Typically, given the claims, models are learned from auxiliary relevant sources such as news articles or social media responses for capturing words and linguistic units that might indicate viewpoint or language style towards the claim Rashkin et al., 2017;Popat et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018). However, the factuality of a claim is independent of people's belief and subjective language use, and human perception is unconsciously prone to misinformation due to the common cognitive biases such as naive realism (Reed et al., 2013) and confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998).", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_para_1": "A recent trend is that researchers are trying to establish more objective tasks and evidence-based verification solutions, which focus on the use of evidence obtained from more reliable sources, e.g., encyclopedia articles, verified news, etc., as an important distinguishing factor (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018). Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral. It is hypothesized that sentence-level evidence can convey more complete and deeper semantics, thus providing stronger NLI capacity between claim and evidence, which would result in better claimspecific representation for the more accurate factchecking decision.", "eba6cf883f6a737cb54fe48458ee0fa1228791fc_para_0": "Smartphones have become an integral part of people's daily lives in many countries around the world. Recent studies have shown that mobile technology use is embedded in various everyday activities [8,49,74,79]. Consequently, researchers have raised concerns about the negative efects of pervasive smartphone use on the quality of face-to-face interactions [2,20,80], hence the term phubbing (phone snubbing), which refers to situations when co-present others are overshadowed by smartphone use. So far, most of the existing studies on smartphone use have been based on surveys, interviews, or data collected in experimental settings. One problem with these approaches is that they often fail to take the interactional context of smartphone use into account. The generalizability of much-published research on this issue is also problematic, as the mainstream approaches do not consider when, how, and by whom smartphone use is initiated (i.e., its communicational motivation) and how co-present others then react to this.

The downstream components, however, cannot impact earlier decision. For example, for the verb \"affect\" in the example shown in Figure 1, there exist two possible concepts: \"affect-01\" and \"affect-02\". Comparatively, the first concept has more common use cases than the second one. But, when the verb \"affect\" is followed by the noun \"ac-cent\", it should evoke the concept \"affect-02\". Obviously, the correct concept choice for the verb \"affect\" should exploit a larger context, and even the whole semantic structure of the sentence, which is more probable to be unfolded at the downstream relation identification stage. This example indicates that it is necessary to allow for the interaction of information between the two stages. To address this problem, in this paper we reformulate this task as a joint parsing problem by exploiting an incremental parsing model. The underlying learning algorithm has shown the effectiveness on some other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as dependency parsing and extraction of entity mentions and relations (Collins and Roark, 2004;Hatori et al., 2012;Li and Ji, 2014). However, compared to these NLP tasks, the AMR parsing is more challenging in that the AMR graph is more complicated. In addition, the nodes in the graph are latent.", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "03c321a8610db95dd15a772a58c2a48776090236_title": "MYND: Unsupervised Evaluation of Novel BCI Control Strategies on Consumer Hardware", "1aba2e7139161fc277e54265e8543539b3c2ca75_title": "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways", "b8c72ae496c0066d76b62e2e05bba0766f3da0a1_title": "Data-Driven Mark Orientation for Trend Estimation in Scatterplots", "60de92ab82e1a73079050a5407d48b6f87fe7ee4_title": "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_para_2": "Basically, the decoder works incrementally, building a state item (i.e. a partial AMR graph) fragment by fragment. When each concept fragment is processed, edges are added between the current concept fragment and its predecessors. However, how to treat its predecessors is a difficult problem. In our experiments, we found that if we consider every preceding concept fragment to the left of the current fragment in a right-to-left order in the search process, the decoder suffers from low efficiency and poor performance. Unlike the beam-search for dependency parsing, which can greatly reduce the search space by exploiting the projectivity property of the dependency tree (Covington, 2001;Zhang and Clark, 2008a), this naive search process in this context inevitably leads to huge search space, and furthermore is difficult to guarantee the connectivity of output graph. Instead, we propose a componentwise beam search scheme, which can not only alleviate much noisy partial candidate, but also ensure that the final output graph is connected.", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "66c87d70cd5e0981ad4c7ae85dff260b2c7e90d7_title": "Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_para_4": "Our work is motivated by JAMR (Flanigan et al., 2014), which is based on a pipelined model, resulting in a large drop in overall performance when moving from gold concepts to system concepts.

Sequence tagging approaches label words as fluent or disfluent using a variety of different techniques, including conditional random fields (CRF) (Georgila, 2009;Ostendorf and Hahn, 2013;Zayats et al., 2014), Max-Margin Markov Networks (M 3 N) (Qian and Liu, 2013), Semi-Markov CRF (Ferguson et al., 2015), and recurrent neural networks (Hough and Schlangen, 2015;Zayats et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016). The main benefit of sequential models is the ability to capture longterm relationships between reparandum and repairs. Noisy channel models (Charniak and Johnson, 2001;Johnson and Charniak, 2004;Zwarts et al., 2010;Lou and Johnson, 2017) use the similarity between reparandum and repair as an indicator of disfluency. Parsing-based approaches (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013;Honnibal and Johnson, 2014;Wu et al., 2015;Yoshikawa et al., 2016;Jamshid Lou et al., 2019) jointly perform parsing and disfluency detection. The joint models can capture long-range dependency of disfluencies as well as chunk-level information.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

However, research has shown that users tend to follow a poor password hygiene by using passwords that are simple to guess and reusing passwords across multiple accounts [45,47,46]. This practice substantially weakens the security of passwords. Furthermore, service providers store the passwords in a database which might be attacked and leaked. Passwords are also susceptible to shoulder-surfing and phishing attacks. A possibility to mitigate the impact of these attacks are authentication mechanisms that combine different factors. The combination of two factors is called two-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication combines more than two factors. A common example of two-factor authentication is the combination of a password or PIN (knowledge) and a token, such as a personal smart card (ownership).", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_para_7": "Some recent work has explicitly examined the usability of security in a university setting.

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces PASTA for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence\u2013table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "313e22afb1e33af6f950e2f2cb3671555aa1e3d8_title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "f48ae425e2567be2d993efcaaf74c2274fc9d7c5_title": "COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "73e851e42286030d7c511e3e74a01fbb0fb0c3b9_title": "monoQA: Multi-Task Learning of Reranking and Answer Extraction for Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering", "aa5b35dcf8b024f5352db73cc3944e8fad4f3793_title": "Pointing the Unknown Words", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "5fefc28ae503c465b1801da2b457f5a2cb5bd51f_para_4": "ProgVGAT  integrates programs and execution into a natural language inference model.

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model\u2019s predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

Ferreira and Vlachos (2016) use news headlines as evidence to predict whether it is for, against or observing a claim. In the Fake News Challenge 2 , the body text of an article is used as evidence to detect the stances relative to the claim made in the headline. Thorne et al. (2018a) formulate the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) task which requires extracting evidence from Wikipedia and synthesizing information from multiple documents to verify the claim. Popat et al. (2018) propose DeClarE, an evidence-aware neural attention model to aggregate salient words from source news articles as the  main evidence to obtain claim-specific representation based on the attention score of each token. Inspired by the FEVER task (Thorne et al., 2018a) and DeClarE (Popat et al., 2018), we propose our approach to claim verification by using representation learning to embed sentence-level evidences based on coherence modeling and natural language inference (NLI). The example in Table 1 illustrates our general idea: given a claim \"The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands\" and its relevant articles, we try to embed into the claim-specific representation those evidential sentences (e.g., s 1 -s 4 ) that are not only topically coherent among themselves considering the claim, but could also semantically infer the claim based on textual entailment relations such as entail, contradict, and neutral.

Following NLI (Bowman et al., 2015), which is a task of classifying the relationship between a pair of sentences, composed by a premise and a hypothesis, as Entails, Contradicts or Neutral, Thorne et al. (2018a) formulated claim verification as a task that aims to classify claims into Supported, Refuted or Not Enough Info (NEI). They released a large dataset containing mutated claims based on relevant Wikipedia articles and developed a basic pipeline with document retrieval, sentence selection, and NLI modules.

In order to focus on the useful evidence in a set of relevant sentences S, we propose a coherence-based attention component by cross-checking if any sentence s i \u2208 S coheres well with the claim and with other sentences in S in terms of topical consistency. Textual Entailment: Entailment is used to measure whether a piece of evidence semantically infers a given claim. We propose an entailmentbased attention component that can be pre-trained to capture entailment relations (Dagan et al., 2010;Bowman et al., 2015) based on sentence pairs labeled with NLI-specific classes: entails, contradicts and neutral.

While the forms of infographics greatly diverge, we focus on one of the most common categories, variations of common data visualizations with visual embellishments. Traditionally, visual embellishments are considered harmful [38]. Visualizations are usually kept plain for the effectiveness of data analysis. Recently, researchers have started to reveal the value of visual embellishments in data communication. For example, Bateman et al. [1] find the recall of embellished charts is significantly higher than plain charts. Haroz et al. [15] learn that ISOTYPE charts are equal to plain charts in terms of reading speed and accuracy, and the added visual information makes them more memorable. Others [5,6,7,35,36] also conclude that appropriate embellishments, such as color and the inclusion of recognizable objects, can increase memorability of visualizations.

In this paper, we do not focus on the results of the tasks themselves other than as a means to assess Karamad in terms of the workers who used our system, the ability of the workers to complete tasks, and Karamad's sustainability.

However, 3.6 billion people \u2013 a workforce comprising 46.4% of the world population \u2013 who could benefit most from this source of income lack the access and literacy to use computers, smartphones, and the internet. In this paper we present Karamad, a voice-based crowdsourcing platform that allows workers in low-resource regions to complete crowd work using low-end phones and receive payments as mobile airtime balance. We explore the usefulness, scalability, and sustainability of Karamad in Pakistan through a 6-month deployment. Without any advertising, training, or airtime subsidies, Karamad organically engaged 725 workers who completed 3,939 tasks (involving 43,006 components) including translations, dataset generation, and surveys on demographics, accessibility, disability, health, employment, and literacy. Collectively, the workers produced a valuable service market for potential customers and included female, unemployed, non-literate, and blind users.", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_2": "Our work is situated at the intersection of crowdsourcing and speech-based services for developing regions. The closest literature to Karamad include Respeak [65], BSpeak [66], Recall [63], and work by Chopra et al. [9]. Respeak is a voice-based system built as an Android application that employs low-income users to transcribe audio files in English and Hindi. BSpeak is a similar platform that allows blind users to transcript audio via speech and automatic-speech recognition. Recall is similar to Respeak, but uses an IVR rather than an Android application, and focuses on evaluating the error rate of transcription tasks over an 8kHz voice channel. Each of these systems leverages users' speaking and listening abilities, and Respeak and Bspeak also require users to have access to smartphones. Recently, Chopra et al. [9] explored an Android-based crowdsourcing platform for allowing low-income users to perform digitization tasks in India in a two-week study.

Over the last decade, IVR platforms for underserved communities seem to have settled on several de facto standards of interface design. These include airtime subsidies, social features, and advertisements to attract and retain users. Prior work shows that lack of airtime subsidy leads to low call volume and engagement [51,62], which causes IVR services to struggle with long-term sustainability [63]. Successful IVR forums have also engaged and retained users through social features (e.g. voting and comments) [49,62], spreading mechanisms such as the ability to forward content to friends [49,50], incentivized referrals [61], and advertisements [41]. Contrary to these prevailing norms, we designed and deployed Karamad without subsidies, social features, spreading mechanisms, or advertisements. Our work advances the existing HCI literature on IVR services for underserved populations by showing that in the absence of such features, paid crowd work can similarly achieve trust, engagement, spread, retention, and self-training.", "2bde99745ed5650cc7c79117d2699da757c66ef9_title": "Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "ffb1f31ea5ba1d00099155248df18e364f8aea90_title": "Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_para_14": "Building on prior work on crowdsourcing behavioral research [19,30,36,47], we found high response rate and survey completion rate of Karamad's surveys on sensitive topics including hepatitis and tuberculosis (attempted by 316 workers, completed by 300), and HIV (attempted by 175 workers, completed by 174).

We did not implement longer speech recordings or multiple digit inputs in Karamad that have been used in the past by IVR-based services [8,41,49,50]. We made Prior work reports that multiple-digit input can be complex for users and suggests incorporating examples to address this issue [8]. We took the approach of restructuring multi-digit input prompts into multiple-choices by segmenting possible answers into ranges. For example, rather than asking for a user's age as multi-digit answer, we reframe the question into a multiple choice question with responses in the form of ranges such as <20, 21-30, 31-40, >40.

These vectors are normally learned such that they are predictive of some word co-occurrence statistic, but they are otherwise unconstrained. However, the words from a given language can be organized in various natural groupings, such as syntactic word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs) and semantic themes (e.g. sports, politics, sentiment). Our hypothesis in this paper is that embedding models can be improved by explicitly imposing a cluster structure on the set of context word vectors. To this end, our model relies on the assumption that context word vectors are drawn from a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, where the parameters of this mixture distribution are jointly optimized with the word vectors. We show that this results in word vectors which are qualitatively different from those obtained with existing word embedding models. We furthermore show that our embedding model can also be used to learn high-quality document representations.", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_3": "In recent years, several approaches that combine the intuitions underlying topic models with word embeddings have been proposed. For example, in (Das et al., 2015) it was proposed to replace the usual representation of topics as multinomial distributions over words by Gaussian distributions over a pre-trained word embedding, while (Batmanghelich et al., 2016) and (Li et al., 2016b) used von Mises-Fisher distributions for this purpose. Note that documents are still modelled as multinomial distributions of topics in these models. In (He et al., 2017) the opposite approach is taken: documents and topics are represented as vectors, with the aim of modelling topic correlations in an efficient way, while each topic is represented as a multinomial distribution over words. In this paper, we take a different approach for learning document vectors, by not considering any documentspecific topic distribution. This allows us to represent document vectors and (context) word vectors in the same space and, as we will see, leads to improved empirical results.", "667d4bedc542f69f06812bb68335c8d559064d44_para_7": "To evaluate the document embeddings, we focus on two downstream applications: categorization and document retrieval.

In the case of the word embedding models, we create document vectors in the same way as we do for our model, by simply replacing the role of target word vectors with document word vectors. In all the datasets, we removed punctuation and non-ASCII characters. We then segmented the sentences using Perl. In all models, parameters were tuned based on a development dataset. To this end, we randomly split our dataset into 60% training, 20% development and 20% testing. We report the results in terms of F1 score on the test set, using the Perf tool 17 . The trained document vectors were used as input to a linear SVM classifier whose trade-off parameter C was tuned from a pool of {10, 50, 100}, which is a common setting in document classification tasks. Note that our experimental setup is inherently different from those setups where a word embedding model is evaluated on the text classification task using deep neural networks, as our focus is on methods that learn document vectors in an unsupervised way. We have therefore adopted a setting where document vectors are used as the input to an SVM classifier. In our model, we have set the number of word embeddings iterations to 50. The parameters of the vMF mixture model were re-computed after every 5 word embedding iterations.

In traditional topic models such as LDA, the topics are typically labelled by the k words that have the highest probability in the topic. These words tend to reflect semantically coherent themes, which is an important reason for the popularity of topic models. Accordingly, measuring the coherence of the top-k words that are identified by a given topic model, for each topic, is a common evaluation measure (Shi et al., 2017). Using the configurations that performed best on the tuning data in the document categorization task above, we used Gensim 27 (\u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek  and Sojka, 2010) to compute the coherence of the top-20 words using the c v metric (R\u00f6der et al., 2015). For our model, GDLA and sHDP, the mixture components that were learned were consided as topics for this experiment. For GloVe, WeMAP, SG, TF-IDF, and CBOW, we used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) soft clustering model (Banerjee et al., 2005) to determine the cluster memberships of the context words. For the TF-IDF results, we instead used hard vMF clustering (Hornik and Gr\u00fcn, 2014), as the movMF results are based on TF-IDF features as well. We tuned the number of clusters using the tuning data. The top-20 words after applying the clustering model were then output based on the distance from the cluster centroid.

For example, (Liu et al., 2015b) first uses the standard LDA model to learn a latent topic assignment for each word occurrence. These assignments are then used to learn vector representations of words and topics. Some extensions of this model have been proposed which jointly learn the topic-specific word vectors and the latent topic assignment (Li et al., 2016a;Shi et al., 2017). The main motivation for these works is to learn topic-specific word representations.

For instance, we might perhaps expect that words from the same part-of-speech class should be clustered together in the word embedding. Similarly, we might expect that organising word vectors in clusters that represent semantic themes would also be beneficial. In fact, a number of approaches have already been proposed that use external knowledge for imposing such a cluster structure, capturing the intuition that words which belong to the same category should be represented by similar vectors (Xu et al., 2014;Guo et al., 2015;Hu et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016c) or be located in a low-dimensional subspace (Jameel and Schockaert, 2016).

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work.

Texts include two essays, a journal article, two blog texts, two history texts from travel guides, and three texts from the fic-  tion genre. Annotation was performed using the web-based SWAN system (G\u00fchring et al., 2016). Annotators were given a short written manual with instructions. We model telicity for dynamic (eventive) verb occurrences because stative verbs (e.g., \"like\") do not have built-in endpoints by definition. Annotators choose one of the labels telic and atelic or they skip clauses that they consider to be stative. In a first round, each verb occurrence was labeled by three annotators (the second author of this paper plus two paid student assistants). They unanimously agreed on telicity labels for 1166 verb occurrences; these are directly used for the gold standard. Cases in which only two annotators agreed on a telicity label (the third annotator may have either disagreed or skipped the clause) are labeled by a fourth independent annotator (the first author), who did not have access to the labels of the first rounds. This second annotation round resulted in 697 further cases in which three annotators gave the same telicity label. Statistics for our final gold standard, which consists of all instances for which at least three out of the four annotators agreed, are shown in Table 1; \"ambiguous\" verb types are those for which the gold standard contains both telic and atelic instances. 510 of the 567 verb types also occur in the InterCorp silver standard, which provides training instances for 69 out of the 70 ambiguous verb types. Finally, there are 446 cases for which no three annotators supplied the same label. Disagreement and skipping was mainly observed for verbs indicating attributions (\"critics claim\" or \"the film uses\"), which can be perceived either as statives or as instances of historic present. Other difficult cases include degree verbs (\"increase\"), aspectual verbs (\"begin\"), perception verbs (\"hear\"), iteratives (\"flash\") and the verb \"do.\" For these cases, decisions how to treat them may have to be made depending on the concrete application; for now, they are excluded from our gold standard. Another source of error is that despite the training, annotators sometimes conflate their world knowledge (i.e., that some events necessarily come to an end eventually, such as the \"swimming in the lake\" in (2)) with the annotation task of determining telicity at a linguistic level.", "73ebd89b20bb1c1a93e79e4b0175e0825b0aecda_title": "Filling the Gaps in Ancient Akkadian Texts: A Masked Language Modelling Approach", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_title": "LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding", "c983102bb0c36b5e7e6ca15f4df2f7dc98b9a9a5_title": "Combining Self-Training and Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Disfluency Detection", "aea0600d241ee9b311ef92eee9c3976fbc7d6ed9_title": "ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation", "88b871d7d46c4e52d98e10a3c959f7230331cc5e_title": "Boundary-Driven Table-Filling for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction", "593e4e749bd2dbcaf8dc25298d830b41d435e435_title": "A Minimal Span-Based Neural Constituency Parser", "4c934343f95950fe10894c35961783b72dc7a8e0_title": "Neural Adaptation Layers for Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition", "6b1ae144bd17a1b60002abd52b19ac9234620ff2_para_0": "Siegel and McKeown (2000, henceforth SMK2000) present the first machine-learning based approach to identifying completedness, i.e., telicity, determining whether an event reaches a culmination or completion point at which a new state is introduced. Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours. Other related work on predicting aspect include systems aiming at identifying lexical aspect (Siegel and McKeown, 2000;Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) or habituals (Mathew and Katz, 2009;Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015).", "f958d4921951e394057a1c4ec33bad9a34e5dad1_title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "0981ce872d31a665882e7677d608351ff5f1de6b_title": "Sorting through the noise: Testing robustness of information processing in pre-trained language models", "817e8a03162adbb268f08b206a5f04c5bfa97b26_title": "Adapting High-resource NMT Models to Translate Low-resource Related Languages without Parallel Data", "bff8ae9e28323d217b9ad5a7321e58f79607f557_title": "A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_title": "Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "529e997e0d9730c25ad4347502da7e5a753274b8_title": "Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural Language Inference", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_title": "SLM: Learning a Discourse Language Representation with Sentence Unshuffling", "4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d_title": "Collective Entity Resolution with Multi-Focal Attention", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "68a7ec5519c733757f87cb08d598c35fbcaff124_title": "Harnessing Pre-Trained Neural Networks with Rules for Formality Style Transfer", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_title": "Diverse Distributions of Self-Supervised Tasks for Meta-Learning in NLP", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_title": "Unsupervised Neural Text Simplification", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "6bf2f1dc081b319ed55f2e185278c7ebfacd9e45_title": "Bridging CNNs, RNNs, and Weighted Finite-State Machines", "5e2b43efb44af88bae17ed1e7932d3df1506dfb6_title": "Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication", "f6bab2ae3bb22d6b91f76d819ac514eb638213e2_title": "AMR Parsing with an Incremental Joint Model", "c0c11be3de5d102b9cd6de1ff7a413a8ea007b92_title": "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning", "6d06dbda28069c4aa86721d0f06b83ab1a30232e_para_1": "Existing work on cross-lingual transfer can be classified into two categories.

Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use.

However, these approaches still require fixing the cameras in the environment or using wearable cameras [19,47], which are expensive, power consuming and might introduce privacy issues [3,22].

The tablet provided the touch input information, such as the number of touch points (e.g., single touch or twofinger touch). The external PC received IMU sensor data through a flexible USB connection for finger tracking, and then sent the finger information to the tablet via a wireless network.

It predicts that users aim for temporal targets differently, with variation by input method, and it points out three stages that affect variability in responses and thereby error rates. This explains a hidden aspect of the finding that touchscreen gaming is associated with much lower performance than gaming with physical keys [5,42,43]. This difference is not trivially due to latency, as one could easily think. The model exposes two factors. Firstly, targeting with the touchscreen is hard because the timing of the sensor event is uncertain. We showed that coinciding of the input event and the moment when the finger has maximum impact on the surface aids in targeting. The Touch-Maximum event allows a user to learn a mapping that is more predictable and therefore improves accuracy. With Touch-Maximum, error rates were decreased by up to 9.0% from the empirical observation. Secondly, Touch-Maximum still suffered from greater noise (c \u03c3 =0.0773) than Key-Press (c \u03c3 =0.0705).

Compared to traditional interactions based on mouse and keyboard input, gestures have the potential to reduce users' cognitive load and visual attention [6,72] and to increase usability by replacing standard shortcuts with more accessible function triggers [27].

This approach invites users to tune in to their body, contrasting many current technology-driven exertion experiences that take the role of sensing and offering feedback to the user via digits, graphs and tables [51]. Here we eliminated screens and focused on making the physical world the place where the interaction occurs between the user and the system. In our study participants practiced reaching peripheral awareness to gain engine support to go faster as a \"fun reward\", making the experience of being \"in sync\" with themselves and the system \"worth it\". One of the opportunities of using indirect physiological signals, such as EEG is that these are difficult to control [37,42] and therefore offer a challenge for mastery. and \"tuning in\" to their inner bodily processes; 2) the system offers feedback in a way that is rewarding to the user, such as increasing engine support; and 3) game theory such as \"flow\" [43] in relation to reactions between the user and the system during integration could be used to dynamically adjust difficulty towards achievement of mastery. Challenges that limit designing for symbiotic-like experiences were quoted by Licklider [33], such as \"the speed mismatch between humans and computers\", where real-time computing was expensive and equipment heavy back then. This reporting of this challenge was followed by \"the problem of language\" where users had to communicate in computer language. Today, home and smartphone assistants require the user to learn commands to raise the system's attention and to instruct the system. With these challenges in mind, our work suggests an implementation where the system can gain access to a user's pre-attentive processing state in real-time in order to automatically act on this pre-attentive processing state before the user is able to.", "9893e9beec96c14f99ed0e06b0a189e11f0bbdcb_para_2": "The literature on designing accessible touch interfaces for people with visual impairments has focused significantly on applications and interaction techniques [7,10,44], while studies on how people with visual impairments use touch input or articulate gestures have been scarce. Nevertheless, the studies that exist have reported valuable and useful data. For example, Kane et al. [23] showed that blind people prefer gestures that use an edge or a corner of the device and Buzzi et al. [11,12] reported preferences for round-shaped gestures, one-finger input, one-stroke gestures, and short trajectories. Detailed examination of gesture articulation paths [23] showed that blind people produce touch gestures that are different in size, speed, number of strokes, and gesture shape than the gestures produced by sighted people. Our work looks in more depth at the differences between gestures articulated by people with and without visual impairments by considering the new perspective of the velocity profiles of the hand producing touch gestures in the context of the formalism of the Kinematic Theory [46].", "8b4ad1d583fdb9e403d7bf63db284fdd329dade7_metadata": "Authors: Serena Wang, Cori Faklaris, Junchao Lin, Laura A.

Previous research efforts generally address the ASTE task in an end-to-end fashion through the table-filling formalization, in which the triplets are represented by a two-dimensional (2D) table of word-pair relations. Under this formalization, a term-level relation is decomposed into multiple independent word-level relations, which leads to relation inconsistency and boundary insensitivity in the face of multi-word aspect terms and opinion terms. To overcome these issues, we propose Boundary-Driven Table-Filling (BDTF), which represents each triplet as a relation region in the 2D table and transforms the ASTE task into detection and classification of relation regions. We also notice that the quality of the table representation greatly affects the performance of BDTF. Therefore, we develop an effective relation representation learning approach to learn the table representation, which can fully exploit both word-to-word interactions and relation-to-relation interactions.

Intuitively, opinion terms are important clues when determining the sentiment polarity and could provide a more detailed sentiment description for the aspect terms. Previous work has generally concentrated on extracting aspect terms and opinion terms and classifying the sentiment expressed on the aspect term without explicitly considering the relations between aspect terms and opinion terms (He et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019;Chen and Qian, 2020). Therefore, Peng et al. (2020) propose the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) task, which is exemplified in Figure 1. In the ASTE task, a triplet consists of an aspect term, the corresponding opinion term, and the expressed sentiment. Peng et al. (2020) adopt the pipeline approach to address the ASTE task. They first decompose the ASTE task into several subtasks and then learn models separately for each subtask.

A detailed analysis of the baseline system is provided in Table 6. The performance on equal and vague is lower than on before and after, probably due to shortage in these labels in the training data and the inherent difficulty in event coreference and temporal vagueness. We can see, though, that the overall performance on MATRES is much better than those in the literature for TempRel extraction, which used to be in the low 50's Ning et al., 2017). The same system was also retrained and tested on the original annotations of TB-Dense (Line \"Original\"), which confirms the significant improvement if the proposed annotation scheme is used.

Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb\u2019s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows.

Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflecting corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5. Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indicate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their usage of \"verb type\" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that \"falling\" is a long event, while \"fall\" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machinereadable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information. Lo\u00e1iciga and Grisot (2016) create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller feature set compared to ours.

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014).

While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table- based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area.

In particular, we design six types of common sentence\u2013table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence\u2013table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pre- trains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two table-based fact verification datasets TabFact and SEM-TAB- FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms previous SOTA by 4.7% (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small test set is narrowed to just 1.5% (90.6% vs. 92.1%).", "43b0f0d2abcafabb31222a6b5b44a085019057b5_metadata": "Authors: Trapit Bansal, K.

However, most existing related models can only deal with the document data of specific language(s) (typically English) included in the pre-training collection, which is extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Language-independent Layout Transformer (LiLT) for structured document understanding. LiLT can be pre-trained on the structured documents of a single language and then directly fine-tuned on other languages with the corresponding off-the-shelf monolingual/multilingual pre-trained textual models. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which enables language-independent benefit from the pre-training of document layout structure.

In our framework, the text and layout information are first decoupled and jointoptimized during pre-training, and then re-coupled for fine-tuning. To ensure that the two modalities have sufficient language-independent interaction, we further propose a novel bi-directional attention complementation mechanism (BiACM) to enhance the cross-modality cooperation. Moreover, we present the key point location (KPL) and crossmodal alignment identification (CAI) tasks, which are combined with the widely-used masked visual-language modeling (MVLM) to serve as our pretraining objectives. During fine-tuning, the layout flow (LiLT) can be separated and combined with the off-the-shelf pre-trained textual models (such as RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), InfoXLM (Chi et al., 2021), etc) to deal with the downstream tasks. In this way, our method decouples and learns the layout knowledge from the monolingual structured documents before generalizing it to the multilingual ones.",

self-supervised pre-training has achieved great success. Inspired by the development of the pre-trained language models in various NLP tasks, recent studies on structured document pre-training (Xu et al., , 2021aLi et al., 2021a,b,c;Appalaraju et al., 2021) have pushed the limits. LayoutLM  modified the BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) architecture by adding 2D spatial coordinate embeddings. In comparison, our LiLT can be regarded as a more powerful and flexible solution for structured document understanding. LayoutLMv2 (Xu et al., 2021a) improved over LayoutLM by treating the visual fea-   tures as separate tokens. Furthermore, additional pre-training tasks were explored to improve the utilization of unlabeled document data. SelfDoc (Li et al., 2021b) established the contextualization over a block of content, while StructuralLM (Li et al., 2021a) proposed cell-level 2D position embeddings and the corresponding pre-training objective. Recently, StrucTexT (Li et al., 2021c) introduced a unified solution to efficiently extract semantic features from different levels and modalities to handle the entity labeling and entity linking tasks. Doc-Former (Appalaraju et al., 2021) designed a novel multi-modal self-attention layer capable of fusing textual, vision and spatial features. Nevertheless, the aforementioned SDU approaches mainly focus on a single language -typically English, which is extremely limited with respect to multilingual application scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, LayoutXLM (Xu et al., 2021b) was the only pre-existing multilingual SDU model, which adopted the multilingual textual model InfoXLM (Chi et al., 2021) as the initialization, and adapted the LayoutLMv2 (Xu et al., 2021a) framework to multilingual structured document pre-training. However, it required a heavy process of multilingual data collection, cleaning and pre-training. On the contrary, our LiLT can deal with the multilingual structured documents by pre-training on the monolingual IIT-CDIP Test Collection 1.0 (Lewis et al., 2006) only.", "b6aa8f08f59f678eab71ee48d72eae841b2890f7_title": "Conversational Futures: Emancipating Conversational Interactions for Futures Worth Wanting", "679c780127ce31f2602c3cb5bb4c3ab93ff0eab8_title": "InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics", "8a00cd8478625ba44787d18015c6f747a71cbeda_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia", "ba6500dc69dc4f8630d9942e57c2852016596a2f_title": "RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications", "d2d3a9d755344019484811a5fbc57a29458948cc_title": "CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", "d6b87816ae50fa110369e2bcb439c29edb8e36b7_title": "Karamad: A Voice-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Underserved Populations", "d8cb361f6dd5da91b75fd498153acee6af0c7730_title": "Constrained Fact Verification for FEVER", "07696855918fd575504b7072b42bf5c863082d2a_para_1": "We show that our method achieves robust improvements over standard BERT's performance on the following downstream NLP tasks: GLUE for Natural Language Inference (Wang et al., 2018), SQuAD for Question Answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), and DiscoEval  for discourse aware sentence representations.

TS is an important task in computational linguistics, and has numerous use-cases in fields of education technology, targeted content creation, language learning, where producing variants of the text with varying degree of simplicity is desired. TS systems are typically designed to simplify from two different linguistic aspects: (a) Lexical aspect, by replacing complex words in the input with simpler synonyms (Devlin, 1998;Candido Jr et al., 2009;Yatskar et al., 2010;Biran et al., 2011;Glava\u0161 and\u0160tajner, 2015), and (b) Syntactic aspect, by altering the inherent hierarchical structure of the sentences (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;Canning and Tait, 1999;Siddharthan, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Brouwers et al., 2014). From the perspective of sentence construction, sentence simplification can be thought to be a form of text-transformation that involves three major types of operations such as (a) splitting (Siddharthan, 2006;Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007;Narayan and Gardent, 2014) (b) deletion/compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002;Clarke and Lapata, 2006;Filippova and Strube, 2008;Rush et al., 2015;Filippova et al., 2015), and (c) paraphrasing (Specia, 2010;Coster and Kauchak, 2011;Wubben et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2016;Nisioi et al., 2017).", "6bbbcb727af7964b05109629d7f05c0da8aa7130_para_0": "Recently, inspired by the rapid development of pre-trained language models of plain texts (Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019b;Bao et al., 2020;Chi et al., 2021), many researches on structured document pre-training (Xu et al., , 2021aLi et al., 2021a,b,c;Appalaraju et al., 2021) have also * Corresponding author.", "77a5e08f361b6f91cac8a24b380a14c12bb93383_title": "Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models", "d8ad95d1918ed72a89fc3d8f842179ee9520cb19_abstract": "The paper presents a first attempt towards unsupervised neural text simplification that relies only on unlabeled text corpora.

Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.", "48bf1d216339ee13ed8e518eb67bf5fef9b001df_para_4": "After differing redundant heads from those important ones in the multi-head self-attention, we further enliven the redundant heads with a syntactic bias per Eq.

We evaluate the performance of applying our method on the low-and high-level encoder layers in the next section, and obtain the best performance when applying on the first encoder layer.

Automatic metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) remain popular due to their fast and free computations. Yet, in the last few years we have seen that, as MT quality improves, automatic metrics become less reliable (Ma et al., 2019;Mathur et al., 2020). For example, in the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)'19 News Translation shared task, the winning system according to human annotators was not even in the top-5 according to BLEU (Barrault et al., 2019). On the other hand, using human assessments can be expensive, especially when evaluating multiple systems. In a real world scenario, given an arbitrary number of MT systems, one would need to evaluate them individually to find the best systems for a given language pair. However, that requires a considerable effort and there may not be enough human annotators to evaluate all the systems' translations.

However, most approaches aim at learning the parameters or feature weights of an MT model (Mathur et al., 2013;Denkowski et al., 2014;Ortiz-Mart\u00ednez, 2016;Sokolov et al., 2016;Nguyen et al., 2017;Lam et al., 2018) or fine-tuning a pretrained model for domain adaptation (Turchi et al., 2017;Karimova et al., 2018;Peris and Casacuberta, 2019). Even in cases where the MT model is composed of several sub-models (e.g., Ortiz-Mart\u00ednez (2016)), the goal is to online learn each sub-model's specific parameters (while our learning goal is the weights of each system in an ensemble). Another key difference between these approaches and ours is that most of them use human post-edited translations as a source of feedback. The exceptions to this are the systems competing for WMT'17 shared task on online bandit learning for MT (Sokolov et al., 2017), as well as Lam et al. (2018), who use (simulated) quality judgments. The most similar proposal to ours is that of Naradowsky et al. (2020), who ensemble different MT systems and dynamically select the best one for a given MT task or domain using stochastic multiarmed bandits and contextual bandits. The bandit algorithms learn from feedback simulated using a sentence-level BLEU score between the selected automatic translation and a reference translation.", "b22218565f562317fe61a2d4914304438ddeb143_title": "JointCL: A Joint Contrastive Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection", "e18c26b9faa94d03af5161cac103289b5f732dae_title": "Sentence-Level Evidence Embedding for Claim Verification with Hierarchical Attention Networks", "f07a48e4b4fb44fc7265680cec1f17fc2f1de19f_title": "Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing", "b896b846ae180d804c7290d8b9ae9ffc55325866_para_4": "We use the LaBSE model to mine parallel text from CommonCrawl, a large-scale multilingual web corpus, and then train NMT models on the mined data.

Word-level F1, commonly used in the Machine Comprehension and ConvQA tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018Choi et al., 2018), evaluates the word overlap between the system's prediction and the ground truth answer span. Meanwhile, the HEQ metric is used to evaluate the percentage of examples for which the deployed model's F1 is equivalent to or higher than the human F1. Given n references (ground-truth answers) for each question, human F1 is calculated by averaging the maximum F1 from each n\u22121 subset with respect to the heldout reference (Choi et al., 2018). This metric is composed of HEQ-Q, computed at the question level, and HEQ-D, computed at the dialogue (conversation) level.

We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods.

As such, the system can learn to process both languages. In one work, Currey and Heafield (2019) improved zero-shot translation using monolingual data on the pivot language. However, in our scenario, there is no parallel data between the low-resource language and any other language. In other work, Arivazhagan et al.

We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks.

The basic idea is to map dependency arcs from a source treebank to its target translation according to word alignments. This method, however, can suffer from imperfect alignment between source and target words. To address this problem, we investigate syntactic transfer by code mixing, translating only confident words in a source treebank. Cross-lingual word embeddings are leveraged for transferring syntactic knowledge to the target from the resulting code-mixed treebank. Experiments on University Dependency Treebanks show that code-mixed treebanks are more effective than translated treebanks, giving highly competitive performances among cross-lingual parsing methods.", "7a49beff86a855f237f96ae3f0aefc9780cb31be_para_5": "Datasets.
